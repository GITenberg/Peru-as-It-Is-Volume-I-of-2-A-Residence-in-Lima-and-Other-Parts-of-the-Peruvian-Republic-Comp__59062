<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In this refined age and country, to make
a graceful appearance as an author requires
endowments to which the writer of the following
pages has no pretension: neither
would he have intruded himself on the public
notice, had he not thought it a duty incumbent
on every one who travels, to give
his own country the benefit of his observation
and experience. He will venture to
assert, that he has had ample means of
making himself acquainted with his subject,
and that he has treated it with candour
and impartiality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>For upwards of ten years he lived in
Peru: sometimes residing among miners;
at other times associating with agriculturists;
and professionally brought into contact
with persons of all classes and ranks
in society, from the palace to the humblest
hut.</p>

<p>In the interior of Peru, but more especially
in Lima, the writer has met with
great courtesy and kindness in private life,
and been distinguished by very flattering
marks of public favour. He therefore, it
may be well believed, has not “set down
aught in malice;” and he trusts that in
the following pages there will not be found
any thing injurious to the Peruvian people,
or at variance with that lasting gratitude
and honest pride with which he remembers
and acknowledges their hospitality.</p>

<p>With respect to the manner of executing
his task, he feels that he requires the
indulgence of his reader; but, with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
to the matter, he persuades himself that,
however unskilfully treated it may be, and
however deficient in that exquisite minuteness
of detail which delights the curious,
it will nevertheless be found to convey to
the intelligent reader a fair general idea of
the physical and moral condition of Peru;
which, as it is all that the writer has aimed
at, so to have attained it is all that he
desires.</p>

<h1>PERU AS IT IS.</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Boundaries of the Peruvian Republic.—General appearance
and climate of the coast.—Seasons divided into Wet and
Dry.—Vegetation.—Lunar influence.—Enervating effects of
the climate of Lima.</p>

</div>

<p>Modern Peru is bounded on the north by
the Republic of the Equator; on the south
by the Republic of Bolivia; on the east by
the Portuguese territories, or Brazil; and on
the west by the Pacific Ocean. The coast
of the Republic of Peru extends along the
shores of the Pacific from the river Loa,
which is the southern boundary that divides
it from Bolivia, to the river Tumbez, which
divides it on the north from Guayaquil, or the
Republic of the Equator. All this extent of
coast, from 3° 30´ to 21° 30´ south latitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
is naturally a desert, intersected by several
rivers, of greater or less magnitude, that
descend along narrow mountain-glens of the
Andes to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Many of these rivers are dried up for
several months in the year; while others, of
larger size, carry a perennial stream, swelling
during the rainy season in the inland country,
and are never seen to shrink so much in
time of drought in the elevated regions from
whence they spring, as not to supply the
means of irrigating and beautifying the maritime
vales through which they flow as they
approach the ocean.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that, while along the
coast of Peru the eye wearies in looking at
sandy plains and hills, we no sooner pass the
river Tumbez than the face of nature changes:
in the former range all looks arid and
scorched; in the latter country all is verdant
and sappy. The coast of the Equatorial Republic
presents to the eye well-wooded plains;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
while on the coast and in the valleys of the
western side of the Peruvian territory, trees,
when not reared by man, are only to be met
growing in favoured places in the vicinity of
springs and rivers. Piura, the most northern
province of Peru along the shores of the Pacific,
is celebrated for its remarkably dry
atmosphere; but in a rainy year, which seldom
happens in this province, the pastures
that suddenly spring up are surpassingly luxuriant,—the
very sand-fields, “arenales,”
after one or two days’ rain, unfold an exuberance
of life and vegetation.</p>

<p>The temperature of the low valleys on
the coast of Peru may be said in general
not to exceed 82° of Fahrenheit in summer,
nor to descend much under 60° in winter.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Where, however, high hills closely overhang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the sandy plains or dry “pampas,” it is
difficult to say to what degree the thermometer
may fall during night, when the
rush of cold air from the upper regions is
in proportion to the degree of radiation
from the plains, and the force with which
the sun’s rays during the day had struck
on the scorched ground. So intensely on
such occasions does the traveller feel the
transition, that, when benighted on desert
places, he is sometimes compelled by the
keenness of the cold to dismount, and bury
himself up to the neck in the warm sand,
until a returning sun again befriend him
on the morrow, and encourage him to pursue
his trackless way.</p>

<p>In Lima, the capital of Peru, neither the
extremes of heat nor of cold are ever experienced;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
an advantage which it partly owes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to its very splendid back-ground of mountains,
rising one above another to the skies.</p>

<p>In winter, the thermometer of Fahrenheit
never, in the centre of the town, falls under
60° in the shade; and, during summer, we
have never seen it rise above 82°,—its usual
station being about 80° in well-aired apartments.
The ordinary difference between
the fall of the night and day thermometer
is only from three to four degrees when
the thermometer is placed inside a common
barred window without glass, and opening
into a veranda or corridor, such as is usual
in Lima houses, for the sake of free ventilation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In the sultry month of February, the thermometer,
if placed on the open and flat-roofed
house-top of mud plaster, rarely ascends above
112°; and at this season, when the hot
noon-day air may be said to be fanned by
the countless “gallinazas,” or vultures, that
wheel and sweep in mid-sky, the canopy
overhead is curtained with white light clouds
that happily protect the city and its inhabitants
from the too scorching beams of a
tropical sun.</p>

<p>The hygrometer—Leslie’s—seldom indicates
fewer than 12° or 15° in the wet season,
and rarely exceeds 50° in the summer
months.</p>

<p>The range of the barometer may be considered
exceedingly limited; for, during the
period of six months that we had the opportunity
of observing barometrical variations,
the mercury was commonly stationary at
29⁹⁄₁₀, and was not seen to fall below 29½
inches. Our means of observation began in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
September, and ended in March, and therefore
included the transition from wet to dry
weather,—from the cool of winter to the
highest heat of summer.</p>

<p>On one occasion when we observed the
barometer fall from 29⁹⁄₁₀ to 29½ inches,
there had been a smart earthquake, which,
though it happened in the usually dry
month of January, was preceded by a gentle
shower of rain, at the appearance of
which the people in the streets rejoiced, and
called it “agua bendita,” holy water!—On
another occasion, when we noticed a
similar sinking of the mercury, the river
Rimac showed by its turbid and swollen
stream that it rained heavily in the higher
mountains.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> As for thunder and lightning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
they have been so rarely witnessed in Lima,
that there they may be said to be unknown.
The above statements regarding the state
of the atmosphere in Lima, it may be proper
to mention, are founded on observations made
by the writer at his residence in Archbishop’s
Street, close to the cathedral and great
square; but about a mile higher up, in a
part of the city called the “Cercado,” the
influence of the adjacent hills is more sensibly
felt in the cooler evenings and mornings;—the
night thermometer sometimes sinks
down to 54° at the orchards of the Cercado,
when in the centre of the city it falls within
an open window or veranda not under 60° of
Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>In Lima the four seasons are by no means
distinctly marked: the dry summer weather
frequently encroaches on the autumnal season,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
supposed to be humid; and again,
the sort of weather and ailments most prevalent
in winter are sometimes continued
through a part of spring.</p>

<p>Hence, though the seasons are usually
distinguished into spring, summer, autumn,
and winter, it would be more truly characteristic
to adhere to the usual division
of the aborigines, into wet and dry.</p>

<p>In May the mornings become damp and
hazy; and, from the beginning to the latter
end of June, more or less drizzly. In October,
again, the rains, which even in the
months of July and August are seldom
heavier than a Scotch mist, cannot be said
to be altogether over, as the days are still
more or less wet, or occasionally there may
be seen to fall a light and passing shower;
the evenings and mornings being damp and
foggy.</p>

<p>In November and December, when the
dry season may be reckoned to have set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in, the weather, except for an interval at
noon, is for the most part cool, bracing,
and delightful: and April, too, is in this
respect an agreeable month; at the latter
end of which, the natives of the capital,
being so exceedingly sensitive as to feel a
difference of only two or three degrees betwixt
the temperature of two succeeding
days like an entire change of climate, are
admonished, by a disagreeable change in
their sensations, to protect themselves by
warm apparel against the chills arising
from an occasional north-west, or from the
influence of the common south-west wind.</p>

<p>Throughout summer the wind blows almost
uniformly, and in gentle breezes, from
the south; but the prevailing wind for nine
months in the year is the south-west, which,
as it mingles with the warmer air along the
arid coasts of Peru, tends to moderate the
temperature of the atmosphere, and to produce
the fog and “garua,” or thick Scotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
mists, of which we have taken notice. During
the dry season on the coast, the rains
are experienced in the interior of the country
and lofty range of the high table-lands,—especially
in the months of January, February,
and March, when the rain that falls
inland is often very heavy, and, on the most
elevated regions, it is not unfrequently alternated
with snow and hail. Thus, the
dry season of the coast is the wet in the
sierra, or mountain land, and <i>vice versâ</i>;
and by merely ascending nigher to the sierra,
or descending close to the sea, without any
appreciable shifting of latitude, the favoured
Peruvians may enjoy, by the short migration
of a few leagues, a perpetual summer
or an endless winter,—if that, indeed, should
be called winter, which is the season of
natural growth and herbage.</p>

<p>Whoever, late in August, or early in September,
has had the good fortune to visit
<i>Buena Vista</i> in the enchanting vale of Lurin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
six or seven leagues south of Lima, and for
many years the hospitable mansion of that
enlightened philanthropist, John Thomas,
Esquire, must have observed that at this
season, when the sandy downs of Lurin are
yet moistened by slight rains and vapours,
and garnished with flowers, such of the trees
in the vale as are not evergreen, and depend
not, like the vegetation of the neighbouring
heights, on the periodical rain of the coast,
impart a certain melancholy hue to the landscape,
as they have already commenced to
shed abroad their sear foliage; and here the
music of the thicket, and booth on the
height, are both in unison with feelings inspired
by the yellow-leaved willows, when
the “lomero,” or herdsman of the downs, tunes
the “yaravi,” a mournful Indian strain, on
his homely lute, and when the <i>cuculi</i>, in a
plaintive note, responds from the guarango
grove.</p>

<p>By the end of September, or beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
spring, we find the trees in the great avenues
around Lima beginning to bud; and the new
leaves expand on them, as the grass dies on
the adjacent hills, or is only seen to preserve
its verdant appearance in the deep clefts and
tops of the hilly recesses of Amencaes.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But
no sooner dies the natural vegetation on the
neighbouring heights, and nearer ridges and
declivities in view of the city, than the fertile
irrigated fields and enclosures throw forth
the waving verdure of a hopeful harvest.</p>

<p>Barley, peas, and maize, sown during the
wet or misty season, come to maturity through
the joint operation of sun and artificial
moisture after all natural or spontaneous
vegetation has withered and disappeared
from the now arid hills and sandy downs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The maize crops the farmers always harvest
in the “<i>menguante</i>,” decrease of the moon;
for it is a fact known to every husbandman,
that if they collect the crop in the “creciente,”
or increase of the moon, it will not
keep free of moths for three months, even
though allowed the advantage of being left
in husk, in which state it is found to be least
liable to damage.</p>

<p>In the valleys around Lima the agriculturist
is very careful not to sow in the creciente,
lest the seed should become so diseased
and injured as never to yield a healthy
crop. The same attention to lunar influence
is bestowed by the wood-cutter, who knows
that timber cut in the creciente soon decays,
and on this account is not of use for constructing
houses, or for any other permanent
purpose; this is particularly the case with
the willow and alder, as the writer had once
occasion to know experimentally. Being
disinclined to believe what he considered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
be the prejudices of the natives respecting
lunar influence, he insisted upon roofing in
part of a house with alder and willow cut in
the creciente; and after a couple of years
he was convinced of his own error, when he
saw the timber employed become quite brittle
and useless, so as to need to be replaced
or supported to prevent the roof from
falling.</p>

<p>The “arriero,” or muleteer, scrupulously
attends to the influence of the moon on his
cattle; for if he travels in the creciente, and
in a warm or even temperate climate, he
takes strict care not to unsaddle his riding-horses,
nor to unpad his cargo-mules, until
they have rested awhile and cooled sufficiently:
and, if he should neglect these precautions,
he would be sure to have his cattle
disabled by large inflammatory swellings,
rapidly running on to suppuration, forming
on their shoulders or loins.</p>

<p>In short, the very “chalan,” or horse-jobber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
will not be prevailed upon to cut the
lampas from a beast’s gums, nor will a Limenian
at any time, except in the “menguante,”
offer to pare his own corns, (and few
are free of such tormentors,) for fear of inducing
severe irritation as the reward of his
indiscretion; and we may reasonably infer
from all these common-place and familiar
facts, that, in Peru, lunar influence is very
remarkable, since both in the animal and
vegetable kingdom it forces itself upon the
attention and experience of every one.</p>

<p>If it be asked what general influence such
a climate as we have now described may
have on the animal frame, we would answer
that there appears to be something peculiarly
enervating and degenerating, aggravated by
the total neglect of sanitary police, in the
state of the atmosphere and locality of Lima.
This effect is observable in the dog species,
which becomes sluggish and spiritless, and
more disposed to bark than to bite; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
shows itself more especially in the male descendants
of unmixed European parentage.</p>

<p>We commonly see the son of the brave
and stately Spaniard dwindle away from the
strength of frame and manly character of his
progenitor. His mind, like his person, becomes
<i>petit-maître</i>; and, though vivacious in
youth, it continues through life to be more
distinguished for readiness than power, for
mobility than vigour.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Chances of life in Lima diminished by neglect of medical
police.—Statements showing the proportion of deaths to
the population of Lima.—Proportion between the different
sexes and castes of the inhabitants.</p>

</div>


<p>If the mildness of contagious epidemic
diseases were to afford a fair test by which
to judge of the climate of any particular
locality, or the medical police of its community,
that of Lima would surely rank as
one of the most favourable. But, however
open and spacious be the construction of
the houses and site of this capital, and whatever
may be said for or against the personal
and domestic cleanliness of its inhabitants,
and other circumstances affecting the health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of individuals, it must be admitted that the
salubrity of Lima, and the chances of life
it affords, are materially diminished from
the want of due attention to public cleanliness.</p>

<p>The aqueducts or canals, which run along
all the principal streets in a direction from
east to west, and give off branches for gardens
and convents, &amp;c. are, after they have
passed the city, to some extent usefully
distributed on fields between it and the sea-port.
But, in general, agriculture, like every
other branch of industry, is neglected since
the revolution. The drains intended to convey
the surplus water from the city over a
gentle slope, to impart that moisture to the
good soil which could not otherwise part
with its nutritive properties, or support vegetation,
are frequently in a ruinous condition.
Thus, the water is suffered to stagnate
in some parts, and run waste in others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
without being applied to those beneficial purposes
of tillage which should be the means
of augmenting the health, population, and
general resources of Lima and its environs.
By the street-canals, are to be seen all day
long the industrious vultures, (by far the
most efficient agents of police,) gulping up
the refuse cast into these receptacles of
every sort of nuisance. When the water
runs in small quantity, or is altogether stopped
from neglect, the quantity of vegetable
and animal deposit carelessly allowed to accumulate
in these channels emits a profusion
of gaseous volatile poison, more or
less penetrating and pernicious, according to
the season of the year and heat of the
weather.</p>

<p>The manure conveyed from the pens
and stables, (which might be applied so
as richly to repay the farmer’s toil, and be
made to beautify at the same time that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
enriched to an incalculable extent the adjacent
plains,)—this manure, when not thrown
into the canals, is conveyed to the broad
walls of the picturesque city, and there heaped
up day after day; or, if not thus disposed
of, it is carried to the river’s brink, where
it is suffered to accumulate into fermenting
mounds of daily increasing size. Here
it absorbs moisture, and generates miasmata
that taint the air breathed by the inhabitants;
and so their sloth is chastised. We
are persuaded that their own culpable inattention
to the cleanliness and salubrity of
their capital contributes largely to entail
upon them a greater proportion of disease
and mortality than could at first sight be
expected from the features of the climate.
Those natives, indeed, who have passed a
life of well-regulated habits, are said to attain
a cheerful old age in Lima; and there
are instances of a few individuals exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a hundred years of age, who preserve
considerable bodily activity and mental
vivacity. There was living, when we
left Lima in 1836, an active little Franciscan
friar, said to be considerably above a hundred.
A Spanish gentleman of the name
of Pellicer, very remarkable for the acuteness
and vigour of his mental powers and
general health, died in our own day, at the
age of a hundred and two or three; and
some other instances of this sort might
be mentioned. These, however, are exceptions.
For it is worthy of particular
remark, that, whatever be the causes that
tend to produce the melancholy result, the
truth is, that the general mortality in Lima
is very great; a fact which the records of
its Pantheon fully confirm, as may be seen
from the annexed documents.</p>

<p>Before we offer any remarks on the above
table taken from a careful examination of the
register-books belonging to the Pantheon, or
public cemetery of Lima, it may not be amiss
to premise what was the population of Lima
when the last census was taken, just before
the revolution broke out, and when that city
is supposed to have been full of people and at
its acme of prosperity. This census, taken
by John Baso, one of the “oidores,” or
judges of that period, and dated at Lima,
September 30, 1818, concludes by the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
summary:—“As is demonstrated
by the preceding statement, the capital of
Lima comprehends within its walls, huts and
cottages contiguous to the city gates, and
suburbs of San Lazaro, 54,098 persons of all
sexes, castes, states, and conditions, which are
distinguished minutely in the same statement,
of which the total amount consists of 27,545
males, and 26,553 females.”</p>

<p>During the ten years embraced by the
above table of mortality, the population of
Lima is always estimated, by the best informed
natives, as much under, as at the
time of the census of Baso it was found
to be above, 50,000; but no data, or
census of later date, by which to verify this
matter in a precise manner, exist in the
hands of the patriots; therefore it is in some
degree subject of conjecture, although from
the number of houses that are now abandoned,
and the great falling away of the agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and horticultural labourers, we are
probably not far from the truth in calling the
average population of the capital and suburbs
during the last ten years 45,000; in which
case the deaths in twenty years will, according
to the above rate, as seen from 1826
to 1835, amount to 47,000,—a number
greater than the whole population given.</p>

<p>It may not be irrelevant to notice that, in
the year 1828, (twenty years after the Pantheon
had been opened for interment,) the
much lamented General La Mar, at that
time president of Peru, visited the burying-ground,
and desired, at the suggestion, we
are told, of Don Mariano Castilla, a gentleman
who had the honour to accompany his
excellency on the occasion, one of the chaplains
of the cemetery, to inform him, after referring
to the proper archives, the total number
of bodies interred for the twenty years
it had then been open to the public; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
we are assured that the result corresponded
closely with the rate expressed in our present
statement. The archives of Beneficencia,
to which the chaplain had recourse, are
now lost or mislaid; but the account he furnished
General La Mar, after these documents,
then extant, were consulted, was published
in some one of the periodicals of that
day, which, however, we ourselves have not
seen. It appears from our table of mortality,
from 1826 to 1835, both years inclusive,
that during the last four years the number of
deaths has augmented in proportion to those
that took place during the preceding six. The
most obvious reason for which, that we can
assign, is, that the late administrator of the
cemetery and keeper of its register, to whose
charge the books were left during the first
six years, was not attentive (as his books yet
testify) to enter the number of <i>espuestos</i>,—in
other words, corpses left secretly in exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
situations, as, for example, at the
Pantheon, hospital, or convent gates; but
his successor (Pasos) has, throughout the
last four years specified, been very careful to
insert a correct enumeration of these cast-away
bodies, as the writer has had an opportunity
of ascertaining in looking over
the books of this obliging person, who lent
his willing aid to procure the details whence
are drawn the general results expressed in
the table.</p>

<p>The number of the <i>espuestos</i> is almost incredible,
and shows the prevalency of great
poverty; for it is but charitable to think
that no one would thus cast away a child’s
remains who was not deprived of the ordinary
means of covering the expense of an
humble interment: but it is said that, in
this business, much fraud is committed by
the parents of the deceased, who, to avoid
paying the regular funeral dues, give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
hearse-men a few reals for picking up the
exposed bodies, and carrying them to the
cemetery to be buried. For these considerations,
it will not be unwarrantable to infer
that the increase of deaths during the last
four years on the table has not been so much
in reality as in appearance, from the omission
of duly registering the <i>espuestos</i>. Nor does
it appear from a document now before us,
titled, “Guia politica, eclesiastica, y militar
del Peru,” by the celebrated and praiseworthy
Dr. D. H. Unanue, published in the
year 1793, that the gross amount of deaths
has altered, in proportion to the existing
population, to that extent which many persons
would incline to believe, in consequence
of the great increase of poverty and demoralization
which have been experienced since
that period. In 1793 the population was
quoted in the “Guia” at 52,627, and the
number of deaths at 2795, not including
such as occurred among nuns or ecclesiastics;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
all of whom, conjointly, formed a large item
in the population of Lima, and must have
had a good many deaths among their number
to increase the real bill of mortality.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It cannot be supposed either, that war had
much share in swelling the Pantheon list of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
dead in these latter years, because, though
civil broils were frequent since the year 1826,
yet Lima itself was not the usual seat of conflict.
Some troops there were always stationed
in this city; but, should these be excluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
from the estimate of the regular population
of the place, still, however, any difference
in the sum of mortality thus produced
from soldiers dying in hospitals and
registered at the cemetery would be, most
likely, more than equalled by the default in
the account of the <i>espuestos</i>, especially
young children, whose remains were irregularly
interred, and so not at all entered upon
the books. And as for the Montonera troops,
or others who met with violent death in or
about town during the late noisy skirmishes,
they were, upon the whole, too inconsiderable
to merit much notice in this place, as appears
very clearly from the various entries made
in the register by Pasos, the present administrator
and book-keeper of the cemetery.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Food, fruit, and water used in Lima.</p>

</div>


<p>As the degree of health, and vigour of
constitution, enjoyed by individuals, depend
in a great measure upon the diet, as well
as on the air they breathe, climate, and
caste, we shall offer a few general observations
on the dietetic habits of the Limenians.</p>

<p>Besides maize, which is more generally
cultivated than wheat, the latter being to a
considerable extent an article of importation
from Chili and other foreign parts, the
staple food of the poor on the coast is
derived from the camote and yuca, both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which roots are exceedingly nutritive and
wholesome; but, in Lima, animal food is
consumed in very large quantity. The
quantity of poultry used here is incalculable;
and a good reason for this is, that the
sick, infirm, and convalescent,—always exceedingly
numerous in this capital, as well
in public hospitals as in private houses,—think
themselves neglected in their diet if
they have not, at least once a day, chicken
or chicken soup. Geese and ducks are in
low reputation as articles of aliment; but of
pigeons and turkeys there is always a large
supply in the daily market, held under sheds
in convenient parts of the town. Fish is
usually good and plentiful,—the fishermen,
by the way, furnishing the best specimen
we have seen of a robust form in the Indian
family.</p>

<p>The number of fat pigs killed in the town
has been, in the year 1835,—on occasion of
imposing, for the support of the colleges, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
duty of four reals, or about two shillings
a-head, on each pig,—estimated considerably
above twenty thousand yearly; and there
is always so large a consumption of lard
and fried pork, (“chicharones,”) that the
trade of the “mantequero,” or lard and
swine-dealer, is, after that of the baker and
lottery-man, “suertero,” one of the most lucrative
in the capital.</p>

<p>From forty to fifty head of oxen, and from
three to four hundred sheep, are slaughtered
daily for the Lima market: the beef is
very good; the mutton of inferior quality.
We were told by one of the principal beef
contractors that, early in the year 1836, the
slaughter of oxen in Lima was reduced to
thirty or thirty-five head daily; a decrease
from the usual number which he ascribed
to the poverty peculiar to that particular
period of misrule, disabling many families
from buying beef, and partly also to a new
military order relating to the soldiers’ rations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of his former allowance of meat,
the soldier was now allowed two reals daily
to provide for himself what food he pleased;—an
injudicious alteration in his circumstances,
for he either gave his ration-money
for drink, or indulged his appetite in eating
some unwholesome trash calculated to throw
him too often on the sick-list.</p>

<p>Pastry and sweet-meat criers are seen
everywhere in the Lima streets; and a sort
of cook-stand, abounding in fried pork and
fish, is to be found at the corner of every
square. This practice gives some insight
into the dietetic habits of the vulgar; and
such poor families of genteel pretensions
as from necessity hire out their slaves, are
seldom at the trouble or expense of cooking
at home when they can more easily call in
from the street what little they may satisfy
themselves with.</p>

<p>Masamorerias, or a sort of pap-shops,
are very common in Lima. Of the sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
pap in vulgar use there are as many varieties
as there are of meal and flour,—such as
peas, beans, rice, maize flour, arrow-root,
starch,—of which they have many varieties.
Any of these boiled in water to a very soft
consistence, with or without the addition
of fruit or some vegetable acid, and sweetened
exceedingly with sugar, molasses, or
“chancaca,” (the latter, a coarse sort of
brown sugar made up into cakes,) is what
constitutes the great Limenian dish “masamora,”
to which these sweet-mouthed people
are as proverbially partial as the English
are to roast-beef.</p>

<p>However salutary in itself may be the
quality of the more substantial food of such
Limenians as can afford to live well and
generously, yet most of their dishes are so
sodden in lard, that the common fowl, the
pigeon, turkey, and that excellent family
dish the “puchero,” consisting of a variety
of fruit and vegetables, with pieces of meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of different kinds and quality, all boiled and
presented in one great piece of plate,—are
among the comparatively few which a simple
palate can relish.</p>

<p>Their soups, together with a great variety
of vegetable dishes, are so heated with agi-pepper,
that the coats of the stomach would
indeed require to be well greased to protect
them against the piquant effects of this
popular condiment. Useful and even necessary
as this agi is found to be by those
Indians of the valleys who cultivate it around
their doors, and whose diet is nearly all
vegetable, yet in a climate like that of Lima,
and in constitutions so delicate as those of
its inhabitants confessedly are, it must prove
injurious to the organization of the stomach,
and to the health in general, when freely and
daily taken with a plentiful allowance of
animal food, and a general mode of living
sober but not temperate; for though the
better classes deal sparingly in wine, yet, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
partaking more or less of every dish at table,
and these not a few, they usually eat more
than the powers of digestion can comfortably
apply to the support of the frame, not usually
exposed by so indolent a people to great
waste from athletic exertion.</p>

<p>The native dark races are indeed much
more robust in form, and hardier in constitution,
than strangers to their climate; and
many of them drink “aguardiente,” or uncoloured
cane spirits, in great quantity, and
with less immediate ill effect than one would
expect. Their constant use of such excitants
as ardent spirits and fermented
beverages called “chichas,” with animal food
and agi, may possibly be a principal reason
why these persons, whenever they are seized
with inflammatory complaints, stand general
bleeding better than others of their own caste
fed upon sango, a name applied to a sort of
mash made with maize-meal and sweet
potatoes: but persons of European descent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with skin so much more delicate than the
darker races in Peru, and endowed with a
more susceptible nervous system, suffer much
more readily from atmospherical vicissitudes;
and their digestive organs and powers of
assimilation being comparatively weak, those
irregularities, borne by the negro and zambo
with comparative impunity, are to the white
man, whose organization is not so suitable
as theirs for a warm and relaxing climate,
the frequent cause of various disorders of
the bowels, as indigestion, cholera morbus,
or dysentery. The dietetics of the
Limenians naturally induce frequent examples
of impaired digestion; and worms,
too usually the inmates of unhealthy bowels,
are so remarkably common, and in
acute febrile diseases are so generally expelled
either dead or alive, that their appearance
in such disorders is looked upon
as a matter of course. What share the
water, as a vehicle for ova, may have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
propagating these worms, it may be difficult
to assign; but as the aqueducts are much
neglected, and proper filtering-stones not in
general use, it is likely that some seeds of
disease may thus enter the system; and it
may be mentioned that, during the warm
weather, a host of animalcules show themselves
to the naked eye in the earthen jars,
or “<i>botijas</i>,” which are kept in the culinary
apartments as receptacles for water intended
for ordinary domestic purposes; and even
water, heated in hot baths to ninety or
more degrees of Fahrenheit, if again allowed
to cool, and stand over a few days, is seen
crowded with myriads of playful animalcules.</p>

<p>Of water taken by the writer from the
fountain of the great square in Lima, just
as the river began to rise in January from
the effects of the inland rains, he is happy
to be able to furnish the following analysis

<p>Nature has supplied the Peruvians of the
coast with fruits most suitable to their
wants; and these, though often injurious
when eaten in a state of immaturity, or
when the stomach is not in a fit state to
receive them, are yet, when used in season,
most grateful to the taste, and salutary to
the constitution, in the regions where they
abound.</p>

<p>We shall, therefore, introduce in this place
a list of the fruits produced in the orchards
in and about Lima, with a specification of
the months when they are in season. This
we are happily able to do by presenting our
readers with a list, obligingly given to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
by Mr. Mathews, an English botanist, now
making rich botanical collections in the interior
of Peru; but whose occupation, as an
horticulturist at Lima, afforded him the best
opportunity for exact and practical information
on the subject.</p>

<p><i>January.</i>—Grapes begin to ripen; and also
apricots, and a few pears.</p>

<p><i>February.</i>—Grapes, pears in abundance,
apricots; peaches begin to ripen; lucumas
scarce; figs.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>—Grapes in abundance; pears
scarce; peaches in abundance; apples begin
to ripen; lucumas in abundance; figs
in abundance.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>—Apples in abundance; quinces,
ceruela de frayle (<i>spondias dulcis</i>), and cerasas
(<i>malpighia glandulosa</i>), palillas (<i>psidium
lineatum</i>), and guavas; figs scarce.</p>

<p><i>May.</i>—The same as April; a few grapes
are seen in the market, brought from the
southward; cherimollas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><i>June.</i>—Cherimollas and guanavanas;
sweet and sour oranges; a few apples.</p>

<p><i>July.</i>—The same as June, with the exception
of apples and limes; sweet lemons
and sour lemons begin to ripen.</p>

<p><i>August.</i>—The same as July; but slight
demand for oranges this month.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>—Lucumas, paltas, and the
fruits of the previous month.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>—Same as September; but a
great demand for limes and sweet lemons.</p>

<p><i>November and December.</i>—During these two months
there is a great demand for sweet and sour lemons, for
“<i>frescos</i>” or cooling drinks. Sweet oranges
rarely remain good after the middle of
November.</p>

<p>Plantains produce all the year, but the
greatest abundance is during the hot months.
The pepino is also much eaten during December,
January, and February. In the
months of April and May, the pulp surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the seeds in the pod of the pacay
are much eaten.</p>

<p>In addition to the above account by Mr.
Mathews, we may notice that the melon and
sandia, or musk and water-melon, are much
cultivated in the neighbourhood of Lima;
and are to be seen in large heaps by the
bridge, and at the corners of streets, where
they are bought up, and consumed with
avidity, in the hot month of February.
Olives too, and very good ones, grow in the
Vale of Rimac, and arrive at maturity in
February and March. During the late civil
wars, several valuable olive plantations were
wantonly cut down. Strawberries, and likewise
“tunas,” or Indian figs, of inferior
quality, grow in Lima; but the market is
supplied with these fruits, and of the best
quality, from the neighbouring valley of Sta.
Ulaya. The pine-apple does not ripen
spontaneously in Lima, though attempts are
now making near the Callao gate of the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to cultivate it. The pine-apple eaten in Lima
is usually brought from the eastern side of
Peru, from the Montaña of Tarma and Guancayo,
&amp;c. Sometimes, also, a few pine-apples
are carried from about Moro on the
coast to the northward; but these often decay
before they arrive in Lima.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Remarks explanatory of certain Dietetic maxims, and established
notions or prejudices, illustrative of the physical
constitution and domestic habits of the Limenians.</p>

</div>


<p>In Lima there are certain opinions and
rules, relating to the nature and cure of diseases,
so very popular and well received
among the vulgar, and at the same time so
habitually countenanced by many of the native
practitioners, that, for any one who proposes
to practise in that part of the world,
and hopes to be honourably acquitted by the
jury of nurses and attendants who are always
numerous about the sick, it may be worth
while to consider the tenor of the following
remarks:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>I. <i>No conoce nuestro clima.</i>—It is affirmed
by native doctors, but not always acceded
to by the vulgar, that there is something
occult in the climate of Lima, which only a
Limenian or Creole physician can sufficiently
comprehend. Hence the prejudiced objection,
“No conoce nuestro clima,”—that is, “he
knows not our climate,”—is sanctioned by high
professional authority; and this much hackneyed
caveat is usually laid at the threshold of
every European doctor who desires to make
himself professionally useful in Lima.</p>

<p>Every one, we think, will admit that the
practice of medicine must be modified, or considerably
altered, according to the topography
of any particular country; for it is observed,
that difference of locality affects not only
man, but plants and animals, in a striking degree
as we extend from the Equator towards
latitudes far to the north or south of it.
Yet, if there be any who understand either
the botany or zoology of Peru, or who endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to illustrate these subjects by their
science and diligence, they are not Peruvians.</p>

<p>The only lover of natural history we have
the honour to be acquainted with in that
country is Don Mariano Rivero of Arequipa;
and, though their tranquil sky might be imagined
to allure Limenians of a philosophic
turn of mind to the contemplation and study
of the heavenly bodies, yet to Dr. Gregorio
Paredes alone belongs, in the present day,
the merit and high distinction of keeping the
sublime vigils of the astronomer. Now this
dearth of native science is not confined to
these general branches of natural history and
philosophy, but affects very sensibly the practice
of medicine. The very manuals of primary
medical instruction put into the hands
of medical students in the capital of Peru
are foreign and European. And thus it is
plain that they have no peculiar and national
digest of medical knowledge—no local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and partial medical code, such as charlatans
and public impostors would desire to insinuate
when they talk of their <i>own</i> practice of
physic, or what they call <i>Medicina del pais</i>.</p>

<p>It is indeed to be hoped that no respectable
physician in Peru will hereafter indulge
in the folly of maintaining that Europeans
are neither fit to practise in that country,
nor able to comprehend the peculiar influences
of the climate of Lima. This climate,
like every other on the known face of the
globe, is open to the investigations of the
meteorological observer, whether he be a native
of the Old or New World.</p>

<p>The laws of physiology, we may further
observe, like those of gravitation, are the
same in Peru as in other parts of the world;
and the aphorisms of Hippocrates, generally
founded on accurate observations made more
than two thousand years ago, are at this day
equally true as when first embodied, and
applicable to man’s physical constitution all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
over the globe. The medical treatment of
diseases, whether conducted at home or
abroad, must be conducted in conformity
with the common and immutable laws of
the animal economy, and with due attention
to the constitution and temperament of individuals.
The locality of the patient’s birth
or residence, the influence of climate, diet,
and habits, &amp;c. are mere accidental circumstances,
secondary and subordinate considerations,
which every physician or medical
officer of our fleets and armies, to whatever
clime he be transported, should be able to
survey and to estimate, like the skilful commander
who, as he reconnoitres his ground,
perceives the local character of a new field of
action.</p>

<p>II. <i>Tomar dulce para bever agua a las
horas de la comida.</i>—This is a standing dietetic
rule observed at the close of a meal or
repast, which means that sugar, or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sweet preserve, is to be taken to give relish
to the water that it is customary to drink at
this time, whether one feel thirsty or not:
they therefore sweeten the palate to enjoy
their simple drink.</p>

<p>Should a Limenian in perfect health, who
thus drinks water at stated periods, feel
thirsty shortly after a meal concluded, as
usual, with sugar or some sweet-meat and
water, he is taught to endure the inconvenience
rather than bring on himself indisposition
by indulging his thirst. To understand
this, it is requisite to know, that, until three
hours have elapsed after the taking of the last
meal, no one is supposed to drink even water,
which is the most common beverage of the
natives; for to commit such an irregularity
would, it is believed, be to occasion a fit of
indigestion or to hazard health.</p>

<p>This may appear a ridiculous prejudice to
those who are accustomed to quench their
thirst, as often as it naturally arises, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
regard to rules; but, on the coast of Peru,
the neglect of this prophylactic rule of only
drinking at stated periods, when it violates
the established habits of an individual trained
up in the observance of it, may be allowed to
be injurious to the health, as it certainly
disturbs the digestive functions. This strict
attention to measured periods of drinking
water is also countenanced in the hill-land of
the interior, where digestion is usually so
vigorous as not to require such nice precaution:
but it is patronised by custom; and this,
no doubt, the majority hold as a sufficient
reason for the continuance of the practice.</p>

<p>When a person suffers from acute febrile
disease, and is only allowed very spare and
tenuous diet, such as chicken soup, panada,
tapioca, or arrow-root, &amp;c.; then, from one
meal to another, the regular interval is five
hours; three hours after each meal, water,
or some medicated drink, is given; and, two
hours after this drink, the allotted aliment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of whatever simple sort it may be, is again
repeated. Thus food and drink are regularly
alternated till the patient is considered to
be in a state which requires the supply of
solid food; and then, as when in ordinary
health, the interval from meal to meal is
understood to be seven hours. The solid food
given to the convalescent generally consists of
chicken, which, of all the items in the list
of Limenian dietary, is that in most general
requisition. Now, for the proper digestion
of the chicken, five hours are allowed before
any medicated drink is ordered after it; and
the principle recognised in this method is,
that drink, which too much dilutes and
weakens the gastric juice in the stomach,
cannot with propriety be taken before chymification
is complete.</p>

<p>Nurses, and very kind and obliging friends,
usually attend so strictly to the above order
in giving food and drink, that, though the
poor patient be burning with thirst, he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
only have permission to quench it at the fixed
and assigned hours; and, through a feeling
of pure benevolence towards the sick, they
interrupt a salutary sleep rather than fail
in punctually giving either drink, nutriment,
or medicine at the corresponding hours.
Under the influence of an amiable sense of
duty, the anxious mother is often heard to
assure the doctor that she herself was attentive
to give her child its drink or medicine at exact
time, as announced from the nearest church
spire by the striking of the clock; though it
grieved her to interrupt its gentle slumber.</p>

<p>During the exacerbations of intermittent
fevers, so prevalent in Peru, the state of the
stomach is usually much disturbed; and in
such circumstances, instead of alternating
food and drink without regard to the condition
of the digestive functions, we have
taken pains to persuade the sick to deviate
from the order established by custom, and
allowed our patients the inexpressible comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of drinking as often as thirst urged
them, until there was obtained a solution of
the febrile exacerbation.</p>

<p>III. <i>Prepararse para tomar purga.</i>—Many
practitioners of the venerable Boerhaavian
school have died in Lima in course of
the last few years, but several of this stock
are yet remaining; and, in their professional
harangues at consultations, they are heard
to talk learnedly of the malignant, adust,
crude, and corrosive, &amp;c. state of the humours
of the human frame, without, as it
always appeared to us, being able to affix
any precise and practical ideas to these hypothetical
expressions. And though the
junior doctors of modernized opinions are
generally found to indulge in some theory
of the abstract solidists, yet they are obliged
to respect the prejudices of the vulgar, and
talk in a way that is agreeable to those
whom it is their business to persuade. Patients,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
blinded by the received notions concerning
the scorched blood, and displaced,
corrupt, or perturbed and jumbled humours,
reckon the daily visit of the physician indispensable
under ordinary circumstances of
indisposition. They do not expect that, day
after day, active drugs are required; but,
according to their own precognition of the
case, they think it necessary for their safety
that their medical adviser make his regular
visits and observations, carefully examine
the various excretions, and so be able to
judge accurately of the character of the
case, and prepare the patient by delay, diet,
and diluents, &amp;c. to take physic in due time,
which is the meaning of the vernacular expression,
“Prepararse para tomar purga.”</p>

<p>IV. <i>Empacho.</i>—This famous Limenian
mischief-maker is supposed to lurk concealed
under almost every form of chronic or intractable
disease, and means, in the most usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
acceptation of the word, a preternaturally
loaded and torpid condition of the bowels:
but, on other occasions, the same word is
used to express the casual lodgement, in any
part of the digestive passages, of some such
matter as the fresh rind of a fig, grape, or
date, keeping up local irritation and fever.
Thus, at one time, the term empacho signifies
a confined and inactive state of the
bowels; and, at other times, indigestion of
some foreign and adherent substance, frequently
giving rise to quite a contrary condition
of gastric disorder: the former is called
simply empacho; the latter is called empacho
pegado,—for the removal of which, a
table-spoonful, or two, of the liquid fat of a
fowl—the <i>enjundia de gallina</i>! is a <i>popular</i>
remedy.</p>

<p>In a large proportion of cases where this
cause of mischief is supposed to exist, it has,
in fact, no place or existence except in the
mind that conceives the notion of it; and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
itself, the fallacy is harmless so long as it is
speculative: but the practice to which it
leads is often mischievous, and it is with
the latter that the practitioner has most
to do.</p>

<p>It would, indeed, be a hopeless task for
the regular practitioners in Peru to reason a
Limenian doctress out of her reveries on the
subject of empacho, which, when viewed by
her as the exciting cause of disease, assumes
a Protean character, and is visible to her
imagination in mostly every case of ailment,
which she, true to her favourite opinion,
offers to cure in her own way.</p>

<p>The evil effects of a farrago of nostrums,
or untimely and inappropriate medicaments
applied by the help of the doctress, the educated
physician is often called, but sometimes
too late, to correct; and the fatal abuses thus
arising have, on various occasions, called
forth the public and earnest remonstrances
of the highest medical tribunal of the country,—but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
all to no purpose, the practice being
rooted in vulgar favour and prejudice.</p>

<p>So universal, indeed, is the credit of the
Limeña quacks, or curanderas, of whom La
Señora Dorotea is the chief, and so general
is the use of the instrument called jeringa,
(through the medium of which the principal
ingredients of this señora’s materia medica
are confidently applied,) that it constitutes
an essential and conspicuous article of domestic
utility. And the great consideration
in which this auxiliary is held, as a <i>sine quâ non</i>
in the treatment of empacho, and almost
every disease, renders it a topic of never-failing
conversation.</p>

<p>As a familiar example of the abuse of the
jeringa, may be mentioned the vulgar practice
of resorting to it in disorders attendant on
dentition. Sometimes the increased action
of the bowels is indiscreetly stopped by astringents
thus adhibited, and a fatal determination
of blood to the head ensues; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
more frequently happens that the contrary
practice is pursued, and stimulant remedies
are administered, which either increase the
existing disease, or transmute it into a dysentery.
On such occasions the skilful practitioner
may endeavour in vain to convince the
mother that her child’s gastric ailment does
not proceed from the presence of the dire empacho.
When, as often happens during the
progress of teething, children are suffered to
eat all sorts of sweets, fruit, and unwholesome
diet, or permitted to partake of strong food
used by adults, and ill-suited to the more delicate
organs of the tender child, then, no
doubt, empacho or indigestion may be traced,
in many cases, as a co-existing cause of the
irritation and disturbance in the bowels, to
which the offspring of white parents are
more particularly subject in Lima. Complicated
cases of this nature demand a prudent
modification in treatment. Yet such instances
are not so frequent as others, independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of indigestion, and in which a moderate
bowel complaint is so far from being injurious
that it is most salutary, as a natural
protection against affections of the head during
the process of teething. It is a peculiarity
connected with the religious belief and popular
customs of the country, that diseases of
infancy and early childhood are too lightly
considered by the native physician. The
reason assigned for this is the devout one,
that little innocents are exempted from the
pangs of Purgatory, which must be borne
by adults for the purification of their souls;
and that therefore, for the child, it is happiness
to die.</p>

<p>We have heard the physician offer this
consolation to a weeping mother in the higher
ranks of society. He softly assured her that
her pretty babe would pass through Purgatory
to Paradise without as much as scorching
a finger in the transit.</p>

<p>In the lower and middle ranks especially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
this religious dogma seems to stifle the natural
emotions of the heart; for, evidently
forgetting that even “Jesus wept,” they celebrate
with music and dancing the death of
the dearest object of a fond parent’s affection,
who, as her child is consigned to a niche in
the Pantheon, bedecks her person, grown
thin by previous care and watching, and
now she smiles in her robes of white, as if
these were indeed no emblems of torn affection!</p>

<p>V. <i>Sangria sobre el empacho.</i>—To bleed
a patient affected with empacho is, by the
common consent of the vulgar, declared to be
a most unpardonable blunder; and this is the
meaning of the expression, “Sangria sobre
el empacho!” when ejaculated in the apartments
of the sick.</p>

<p>It will be readily imagined that, in numerous
instances coming under the vulgar denomination
of empacho, the subtraction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
blood will be a necessary measure before
purgatives can be properly or safely resorted
to, with a view to remove from the bowels
the irritating cause lodged there, and affecting
the general system.</p>

<p>But to avoid the unjust criticism of
uncharitable members of the profession,
who are always ready to turn to their
private advantage, any popular prejudice
which can be called in to humble the
name of fellow-practitioners more respectable
than themselves, and also as a mean
either to acquire or to preserve the confidence
of the sick, the prudent physician
will not overlook the natural effects of any
known prepossession regarding blood-letting.
He will so far accommodate his practice to
the ideas of those who are most interested
in the issue of his treatment, as to order at
least one enema, when the empacho is firmly
believed to exist, before he proceed to the
further discharge of his professional duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and fulfilment of the indication of the case,
by ordering the lancet to be applied.</p>

<p>No time or advantage is lost by such a
concession to the preconceived and inflexible
opinion, that bleeding is particularly hurtful
in those cases of illness connected with
undue accumulations in the bowels: but one
very important end is gained by it; since, by
agreeing with the sick and their friends on
an indifferent point of practice, they will
more willingly submit to the application of
other remedies necessary for the safety of
the patient.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Cosas frias y calientes.</i>—All articles
of diet, and medicaments, are by the Peruvians
vulgarly divided into cold and hot;
or, as the words on which we are about
to comment express it, into “cosas frias y
calientes.”</p>

<p>When the physician prescribes any particular
diet or physic to a patient in Lima,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he must be ready to answer many inquiries
regarding the qualities of the things
prescribed.</p>

<p>Besides professed sick-tenders, zamba
housekeepers or head-servants, some women
in the middle and humbler ranks, such
as manteras, chocolateras, tenderas, cigareras,
picanteras, pulperas, changaneras,—that
is, female shopkeepers, chocolate and cigar
venders, with a subordinate gradation of
publicans, &amp;c.—are always ready to talk,
with confounding fluency and volubility,
without knowledge, concerning qualities and
temperaments; and they display a natural
acuteness of metaphysical capacity, with a
truly peripatetic nicety of discrimination,
when, in a moment of oratorical excitement,
they assign to certain mixtures and drinks
ideal measures and degrees of the elementary
qualities. Women skilled in such mysteries,
and omniscient charlatans, run over the various
combinations of the cold and hot, dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and humid, and all their resulting modifications
of temperature and temperament, with
apparently unerring precision, and with a
graduated exactness which no chemist in
Europe, with every advantage of science and
apparatus, can pretend to equal in his elaborate
investigations into the qualities and elements
of bodies either living or inanimate.</p>

<p>The particular temperament of the patient
his intimate friends are supposed to know
perfectly; and the doctor’s reply to any question
that may be proposed to him on this
subject will be considered, in many instances,
as no bad test of his penetration and professional
knowledge in other matters with which
they do not presume to be themselves so
well acquainted.</p>

<p>In conformity with such prevailing impressions,
when nurses are to be selected for the
children of delicate mothers, preference is
given to the black women, as their blood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
milk are believed to be cooler and more refreshing
than the same fluids are in women
of a different race. The Indian woman, on
the other hand, is considered inferior to the
negress as a nurse, because she is believed to
be of a comparatively hot temperament and
constitution. The effect of the quality of
the nurse’s milk is conceived to influence
the future temperament of the infant that
hangs on her breast; and it is sometimes assigned
as a reason why an individual is of an
ardent temperament, that when a child he
had been weaned, or deprived of the breast,
by giving him wine,—<i>se desteto con vino</i>.</p>

<p>Colour is looked upon as an indication of
constitutional temperament even in the lower
animals. Thus, when one in town labours
under hectic fever, or consumption, he is recommended
to go to the country, and drink
warm milk from a black cow, because it is
allowed to be more cooling and febrifuge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
than the milk taken from a cow of any other
colour.</p>

<p>In case of a rheumatic swelling of a joint,—the
knee, for instance,—or some tumefaction
in any of the glands, it is taken for
granted, that, whatever other remedy be applied,
the envelope for the limb or part affected
must be of a medicinal colour, and
consist of black wool, or something of a dark
woollen texture. In short, so far has this
general idea concerning the antiphlogistic
nature of black been carried, that few natives
dispute its accuracy: nor are we prepared
to say that it may not have some foundation
in fact and observation (though often
laughed at by strangers as a puerile prejudice);
for it is well known to scientific
men, that the free radiation of heat is much
influenced by the differences of colour in
the radiating surfaces of bodies.</p>

<p>With respect to food and drink, the division
into cold and hot is never overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>A “<i>traguito</i>,” or little dram of Italia, a
colourless brandy made on the coast, the
old men consider as <i>fresco</i>, or cooling,
when taken immediately after dinner; and
when they take the “<i>traguito</i>,” which
they do not every day, it will probably
facilitate the digestion of the greasy food
which they are commonly accustomed
to eat, and in this manner deserve the
name of a <i>fresco</i>. But, again, though at
their entertainments they allow wine to be
a safe and good drink after the “<i>helados</i>,”
or ices, which they like exceedingly, still
they use wine sparingly on other occasions,
as they consider it too heating for general
use. There are fruits after which the natives
do not think it safe to drink either
wine or spirits; of this sort is the short
plantain, called “platano de guinea,” after
which a mouthful of spirits would be considered
quite poisonous. Foreigners do not
seem to attend to this strict rule observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by the natives; nor is the violation of it,
as far as we know, attended with any serious
consequence to them.</p>

<p>Various kinds of fruit and vegetable
juices, which are considered cool in their
qualities, are not rarely most heating in
their effects, according to the condition of
the system when taken. The melon is in
reputation for its cooling nature; but,
though the impression made by it on our
alimentary organs is at first very refreshing,
the muleteer who journeys from the
Cordillera to the coast, and has but once
in his lifetime been attacked with a gastric
tertian, in consequence of cooling
his parched fauces by eating of the melon,
can give a lively account of the internal
heat, agitation, and oppression experienced
by him on the occasion. There is
no cooling fruit safer than the granadilla,
which is most grateful and refreshing to
the feverish patient, or thirsty traveller in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the scorched and rock-bound ravines and narrow
valleys of the interior, where this fruit
is often abundant, as it is also on the coast
in its proper season.</p>

<p>Fowls are reckoned to be infinitely <i>cooler</i>
in their temperament than sheep or oxen,
and their flesh is also considered as very
safe and cooling; hence the almost universal
use of the former, and prohibition or disuse
of the latter, in the dietary of a delicate
invalid. This distinction will appear still
more strongly marked, when it is observed,
that to prescribe beef-tea in any acute disease
would be deemed an act of rashness
and ignorance; but chicken-tea is held to
be the most cooling of diluents, and very
eligible in the most inflammatory diseases
and in the warmest weather.</p>

<p>This chicken-tea, called “agua de pollo,”
is commonly prepared in the proportions of
three cupsfull of water to one half of a little
unfledged chicken, with the addition of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
mallow leaf or two, and the core of a lettuce,
(cogollo de lechuga,) by which latter in particular
its cooling properties are said to be
exalted. After the ingredients are boiled
together for a proper length of time, the
clear decoction is poured off for use. The
great efficacy of this drink is accredited by
the undisputed consent of doctors of all colours,
and matrons as well as nurses of all
sorts and temperaments.</p>

<p>It is needless to remark that, in general,
plain water or toast-water, or a ptisan of barley
decocted with some of the subacid fruits of
the country, would answer very agreeably the
purpose of the agua de pollo; but when the
latter is preferred, it should be remembered
that in warm weather it decomposes rapidly,
and then acquires irritating properties. As a
purgative, in gastric disorders, the old physicians
in Lima extol almond oil, which is
often of inferior quality; and they take some
pains to arm the minds of the credulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
against the use of the best castor-oil of European
preparation, by telling them that it
is extracted from the seeds of the “higuerilla,”
or castor-oil shrub, everywhere indigenous
in the warm valleys of the interior; and
these seeds are generally known to be excessively
drastic when taken as the peasants use
them, in the dose of two or three bruised,
and then swallowed in substance. Now
from the seeds the native apothecaries prepare
an impure oil, which is sold in the shops
under the name of “oil of higuerilla;” and as
it is only used for burning in lamps, when
the vulgar learn that castor-oil is but another
name for the same, they naturally consider
it as essentially hot, and most heating
and improper for internal use. The vulgar
should be advised by every ingenuous and
intelligent member of the profession, that
the fault is not in the remedy, but in the
way of preparing it: and this remark may
be extended to the delicate preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from the mineral kingdom, which acquire a
bad name when badly prepared, as is necessarily
the case in Lima, where chemistry is
so little cultivated or practised as a science.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Los acidos son malos para el pecho.</i>—No
class of remedies is in more general use
in Lima than vegetable acids in the bilious
disorders of daily occurrence; but in affections
of the chest, whether simply catarrhal,
or of the more serious forms of pneumonia
or phthisis, it is a generally received and
settled opinion that acids of all sorts are
injurious, which they make known by such
expressions as these: “Los acidos son malos
para el pecho,”—acids are bad for the breast;
“Los acidos cierran el pecho,”—acids shut
up the breast.</p>

<p>This opinion seems to have partly originated
from a notion, once entertained by the
doctors, that acids coagulate the animal
fluids, and so produce obstructions and disease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
It is made evident to our senses,
that milk secreted from the blood is readily
coagulated by acids; and thus they seem to
conceive that something of the same process
takes place in the circulating fluids of
the body when acids are taken into the
system.</p>

<p>Not only the vulgar, but some of the professional
characters, appear to be impressed
with the notion that the blood is thickened
or curdled by acids, whether mineral or vegetable;
and that the delicate circulation of
the lungs is consequently impeded, and the
respiratory pores clogged. This opinion appears
to be expressed in the very common
remark, “El enfermo tomo fresco de lemon,
y con el acido se le ha tupido el pecho,”
which means that the patient drank cold
lemonade, and with the acid the breast was
stopped up.</p>

<p>We are well persuaded that there are
instances, especially among delicate females,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
where the respiratory organs are so susceptible
of impressions, that the immediate refrigerating
effects of cool acidulated drinks
on the stomach of such persons extend
rapidly, by sympathy, from the stomach to
the surface of the body and lungs; and
there produce a certain degree of constriction
on the exhaling vessels, which disturbs
their healthy action.</p>

<p>It is only in this manner we can account
for the fact, as frequently stated to
us by patients, that, as certainly as they
did take anything cool and acidulated, they
were speedily affected with a tightness about
the chest, and felt as if they had actually
caught cold. On such occasions their usual
observation was, “El acido me ha cerrado el
pecho,”—the acid has locked or closely shut
the breast.</p>

<p>A complicated ailment which is vulgarly
conceived to be seated in the chest, is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
met with in Lima during the sultry months
of January, February, and March. It is
attended with a short and dry cough, a
foul tongue, and evening fever, or restlessness,
that chases away sleep. The patient
becomes low-spirited and anxious; and dreads
an approaching attack of consumption, or
spitting of blood.</p>

<p>In such disorders, the gastric and hepatic
functions may be suspected of some irregularity;
and, when in any case this is explained
to the patient, the disease may be
treated as one seated in the organs of digestion,
and <i>frescos</i> or cooling acidulated drinks
often do wonders. Not only diluted in cold
water, but with the addition of ice, the various
vegetable acids of the season are given
with the best results. They break up the
whole chain of morbid symptoms; and the
patient, thus encouraged and refreshed,
completes convalescence by cold sea-bathing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and a few weeks’ residence at the neat village
of Mira-flores, a few miles from the
capital.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire year, but more
particularly during the warmer months,
great use, and no small abuse, is made of
all sorts of <i>frescos</i>, or cooling and acidulated
drinks, with or without the addition of ice,
and other ingredients of a very opposite
nature, as pimento and spices, which latter
render the same drink heating to the stomach,
that, by ice, is rendered cool on the
lip.</p>

<p>There are no beverages which the vulgar
misapply more than their <i>frescos</i>. The most
approved of these, as tamarinds and whey,
or the juice of the apple and quince, &amp;c.
diffused in water and sweetened with sugar,
are sometimes so long continued with a view
of cooling and purifying the blood, that they
finally relax and weaken the stomach; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
which there are heard many complaints.
Again, iced water, or iced acidulated <i>frescos</i>,
are frequently misapplied in the common
acute diseases of the country when the patients
are in a free sweat; for, by suddenly
checking a salutary perspiration, very bad
consequences may follow: but this, though
a well-known fact, is too often overlooked.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Acido sobre la leche es malo.</i>—It is
particularly worthy of notice that, shortly before
or after milk happens to be taken pure as
a drink, or mixed up in some culinary form
as an article of diet, it is believed that no
acid can be safely received into the stomach;
it being thought necessary that the interval
between these incompatible ingredients should
be seven hours at least.</p>

<p>In illustration of the fact here stated, it
may be mentioned that we were once called
to see a lady in Lima who had been ailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
for about a twelvemonth; and, on inquiring
why she had delayed her cure so long, her
reply was,—</p>

<p>“A year ago, on my arrival from Valparaiso,
I called in Dr. ——, a French physician,
who ordered me to confine myself to a
rice and milk diet alternated with lemonade.
I felt so greatly shocked at this gentleman’s
extraordinary error in prescribing such treatment,
which every one knows to be most
hurtful, not only to the infirm, but to the
sound and healthy, that I resolved at the
time to leave my complaints to nature, rather
than expose my life to the greater indiscretion
of some other doctor of less fame.”</p>

<p>In this instance the error, for which the
French physician was blamed, consisted in
his having overlooked the popular rule universal
in Peru, and probably not unknown
in Chile, that “acido sobre la leche es malo,”
viz. that acid after milk is hurtful.</p>

<p>According to this rule in Peruvian dietetics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
it would be considered little short of
poisonous to use milk or cream with any sort
of fruit, jam, or preserve containing the
least quantity of acid. And here it may be
noticed, that in their own preserves, they
completely destroy the rich and distinguishing
flavour of the fruit by an excess of sugar,
just as they annihilate, in very bad taste, the
peculiar and natural fragrance of their finest
flowers by sprinkling upon them foreign and
artificial perfumes.</p>

<p>IX. <i>Los olores son malos para las recien
paridas.</i>—It is one of the social customs of
Peru, sometimes attended with great inconvenience,
that friends and visitors, moved by
feelings of kindness, crowd into the rooms
of the sick, when not perhaps in a fit state to
enjoy company or conversation.</p>

<p>During their confinement ladies are not
sufficiently exempted from this friendly intrusion,
or neighbourly attention. The only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
restraint imposed upon those who visit a
lady on such an occasion is, that they do not
enter her apartment with flowers or perfumes;
nor are the attendants permitted to
introduce censers with the fumes of burning
incense, as is customary at other times.
Thus, it is acknowledged that “Los olores
son malos para las recien paridas,” viz. that
perfumes are injurious to women during
their confinement; and they certainly are so,
for they are frequently observed to give rise
to fainting, convulsions, or other bad consequences.
These precautions all who visit or
wait upon the sick are strict in observing;
and so much the more, as it is customary
for females in every rank to use perfumes
on their dress, and to decorate their heads
with flowers for evening visits: a practice
in which the woolly-haired negress and mulatta
greatly excel, as they love to adorn
their stunted curls with flowers of aroma
and jessamine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Parturient women are very subject to a
sensation of languor and exhaustion at
stomach, attended with a feeling of faintness,
which they call “<i>fatiga</i>.” On ordinary
occasions, when this feeling or sensation
is experienced by females not similarly situated,
it is usual to resort to cordials and odoriferous
draughts containing lavender, hartshorn,
&amp;c. and also to stimulating embrocations
applied over the seat of the stomach, which
usually consist of a camphorated mixture,
or perhaps Cologne water, and other such
remedies applied in common cases of weakness
and faintness referred to the stomach;
but, under the circumstances to which our
rule refers, all applications of this sort are
inadmissible.</p>

<p>When there is a feeling of sickness and
faintness, with a disconsolate sensation (called
“un desconsuelo”) at the epigastrium or
scrobiculus cordis, they are allowed on all
occasions to apply to the stomach, as a popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
remedy with the matrons, a bit of warm
toast, or the breast of a fowl sprinkled over
with powdered cinnamon and moistened with
wine, or, as it is vernacularly expressed,
“la pechuga de gallina con vino y canela;”
and they agree that this application, which
possesses a great deal of their confidence,
commonly produces the best effects.</p>

<p>X. <i>Tomar agua fria encima de colera.</i>—To
drink cold water immediately after a fit of
anger, which is the meaning of the words in
our text, is a frequent cause of ailment, and
one which the practitioner every day hears
of as the origin of the worst cases of visceral
obstructions or hepatic disease. Unfortunately,
the occasions of such attacks are of
ordinary occurrence; for the temper of those
who suffer from them is rarely under proper
control, and, as a necessary consequence of
the existing state of society, provocations to
anger are common in every situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>We were once consulted by a curate of an
irritable disposition, and an epicure in his
taste, on account of an induration and very
prominent enlargement of the liver, which
some time after ended in a fatal abscess.
This gentleman assigned, as the exciting
cause of his malady, his having drunk cold
water when angry, or on occasion of a quarrel
he had with his cook, a Zamba girl, who
we may suppose must have spoiled some
favourite sauce.</p>

<p>This was the first time we were consulted
on an ailment said to arise from drinking cold
water when angry. But afterwards, as we
had engaged in more general practice, we
were called upon to listen to very many
statements of the same sort; and, on such
multiplied and independent evidence, we are
compelled to believe that this is indeed
one of the usual causes of hepatic derangement
very prevalent in Peru.</p>

<p>During these fits of anger the brain appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to be greatly excited, and the flow
of blood to it increased; and the liver,
which readily sympathises with the brain
in our mental states of angry emotion,
seems to be at the same time gorged with
blood. Under these circumstances, we think
a draught of cold water operates injuriously,
by creating a sudden chill within, and inducing,
through the channel of sympathy
between the stomach and liver, contraction
of the biliary excretories, which lays the
foundation of more permanent congestion
and consequent inflammation, by preventing
the natural relief which should arise from
a free flow of bile. That the ready flow
or free outlet of bile is the natural and
proper medium of relief in such cases, every
one has an opportunity to judge; for fits
of anger are so common in Lima, that
a day never passes without witnessing or
hearing of their ill consequences; and the
most familiar and immediate effect is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
bilious disorder of the bowels, or indigestion
and subsequent vomiting,—just as the stomach
happens to be occupied, or otherwise,
during the period of mental perturbation.</p>

<p>We may remark, that ice and iced water
are only considered safe (even by the vulgar,
who use them daily with a view to restrain
the excessive flow of bile consequent on an
angry or choleric fit,) when they are given
after the violence of the commotion is over,
and after the stomach, if it happen to be
loaded, has, by drinking warm water or otherwise,
been freed of its contents; but in
hot weather, when the skin is more relaxed,
and the bilious secretion more plentiful and
redundant than common, ices are much
used, and iced water forms the usual drink
at the hour of meals.</p>

<p>We meet with persons who never experience
the smallest annoyance or approach to
anger, without being affected by some corresponding
movement in the bowels; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
others are never known to get warm in
earnest discussion without feeling some derangement
at the stomach, or showing on
the following day a white or furred tongue.
In truth, the delicacy of the digestive organs,
or that mobility by which their functions
are so easily affected by mental
emotions, is quite extraordinary; and, as
the daily repair and due sustenance of the
whole frame depends on the regular and
healthy discharge of the digestive functions,
it is not to be wondered at that, among a
people by no means intellectual in their
habits, the sword should often be observed
to wear out its scabbard,—in other words,
that the frequent agitations of passion should
induce serious diseases, and easily wear out
the frame in a country where the sympathy
between the mind and chylopoetic organs is
so very marked and influential. Hence the
anxiety which experienced natives feel at the
hour of awakening repentance, or the return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of sober reflection, after a culpable indulgence
of anger; and hence, too, the rigid
abstinence or tenuous diet attended to after
one has been fretful or out of temper, till
the pulse is again observed to be natural,
and the organs of digestion sufficiently composed:
and to show how far these painful
states of mind may affect the secretion of
milk, we have only to recollect that the
Limeña will hear her babe cry a whole
day, rather than harm it by giving the
breast till her own agitation, which she
knows vitiates her milk, is quieted after
one of those choleric movements which it
has been either her fault or misfortune to
suffer.</p>

<p>XI. <i>Si se puede lavarse con agua fria.</i>—In
almost every case of lingering illness in
either sex, it is vexatious to witness the
reluctance to ablution that prevails in the
capital; and this prejudice, with the dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of shaving connected with it, is particularly
cherished among those who have been delicately
nurtured; the male part of whom
are often heard to ask “si se puede lavarse
con agua fria o afeytarse?”—if it be safe to
wash with cold water or to shave.</p>

<p>The Limenians are fond of seasonal bathing
and the pleasures of a watering-place,
which they know how to enjoy for three
months in the year.</p>

<p>Chorrillos, three leagues to the south of
Lima, is the favourite watering-place, much
frequented during the sultry summer months
by gambling parties, and persons of rank and
fashion from town. It is only a small village
of fishermen, and constructed of cane
and mud. The Indian owners of the shades,
and neatly constructed houses or <i>ranchos</i>, let
them to the bathers at a high rate during
the bathing season; and some persons either
take these for a term of years, or construct
other light summer houses for themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
which they fit up very tastefully, and pass
the summer months in them in the midst
of gaiety and mirth. Chorrillos is sheltered
from the south-western blast by an elevated
promontory, called the Moro-Solar, which
rises like a gigantic guaca overlooking the
numerous monuments, or pagan temples,
of this name, which are scattered over the
naturally rich, but now in a great measure
waste and desolate plain, that extends from
Lima to Chorrillos.</p>

<p>During the raw, damp, and foggy months
of July and August in Lima, Chorrillos enjoys
a clear sky and a genial air. The
south-westers laden with heavy clouds spend
their strength on the friendly Moro-Solar,
(on which burst the only thunder-storm
witnessed by the Limenians in the memory
of any one now living,) and divide into two
currents: the one pursues the direction of
the village of Mira-flores, and the other the
hacienda of San Juan, leaving Chorrillos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
clear and serene between. Thus protected,
the village of Chorrillos feels not the chilly
mists of winter; and it is the great hospital
of convalescence for agueish, asthmatic, dysenteric,
rheumatic, and various other sorts
of invalids from the capital during the
misty season, when the clinking of dollars
and noise of the die no longer disturb the
repose of the sickly.</p>

<p>The salutary practice of bathing in the sea
was in former times confined chiefly to those
affected with cutaneous diseases; but within
the last forty or fifty years, as we are told,
sea-bathing has been preferred to river-bathing,
or to the cold baths by the old Alameda,
and fountain of Piedra-lisa. The women
are usually cleanly in their persons; but,
however congenial cleanliness may be to
their sex, they, like the sick and bearded
men, seem to be greatly afraid of ablution
in hectic fever, and some thoracic diseases
with which they are often visited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Indian in the interior we need not
speak in the same breath with his brother in
the capital, or with the maritime Indian,
whose ordinary occupation in fishing, or
more delicate engagement of safely conducting
the ladies over the surf during the bathing
season, especially at Chorrillos, necessarily
leads to cleanliness. But the indigenous
mountaineers never perhaps in the
whole course of life wash their bodies thoroughly;
and their skin (at least in the warm
valleys) is habitually covered with a thick
coating of perspirable matter and extraneous
dirt, which it is not easy to wipe off.</p>

<p>In very many cases of acute disease, the
warm bath is, with the natives of the coast,
a favourite and most valuable remedy, rarely
neglected; but its application is usually forbidden
in affections of the chest.</p>

<p>It will be readily imagined that the frames
of those who fly from impressions of cool air
and hazy weather, which, with all their care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to shun, they cannot entirely escape, easily
become so sensitive as to render them more
susceptible in proportion to their self-indulgence,
and more liable to catarrhal affections,
than those who, by free exposure of
their persons, train their constitutions to
greater hardihood.</p>

<p>As evidence of the evil results arising
from the vain endeavour to avoid the impression
of the common physical causes to
which, through life, every one must be occasionally
exposed, we would particularly
notice the peculiar delicacy of the delicately
reared Limenian. When somewhat weakened
by bad health, or a slight indisposition
which confines him to his apartments for a
few days, should he happen to shave and
wash the face with cold water, he is thereby
put in danger of being visited by a spasmodic
affection of one side of the mouth, or
affected, as is more likely to take place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with a cold in the head; so that the inflammation
thus induced in the nostrils and
fauces may soon be observed to extend itself
along the continuous mucous membrane, and
through the windpipe into the cavity of the
chest; and there it is hard to foretel what
ravages it may commit.</p>

<p>We need not therefore be surprised to
hear the often reiterated query of the convalescent
in the words, “No me hara daño
lavar y afeytarme?”—will it not do me harm
to shave and wash? Nor should we indulge in
a smile at his expense, as we see him gradually
venture on the first degrees of ablution,
by rubbing over the hands and face with a
cloth dipped in tepid water sharpened with
aguardiente, or the common spirits of the
country.</p>

<p>XII.—<i>Morir en regla.</i> This expression,
which means to die according to rule, is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
which all good Catholics are most solicitous
to realize for themselves and friends; and
the custom it refers to is deemed of the utmost
importance in a religious and professional
point of view.</p>

<p>When a physician visits a patient, and
finds him in a doubtful or critical state, he
must never omit to warn the patient or his
friends of his real situation, with a view to
enable them to call a medical consultation,
and allow time for testamentary preparations
and spiritual confession. The neglect of this
precautionary measure would, in the event of
the disease terminating fatally, bring great
blame on the physician; but, after he has
notified what he considers to be the patient’s
real condition, then, whether the
parties interested in such communication
choose to act upon his advice or not, he has
acquitted himself properly; and when the
patient, previously confessed and sacramented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
dies with the benefit of a consultation,
or duly assisted by a medical junta, he is
said to die according to rule, that is, <i>morir
en regla</i>.</p>

<p>The great medical juntas in Lima, by
which we understand consultations where
more than four or five doctors are met together,
are remarkable occasions of oratorical
display. The warmest discussion frequently
turns on the dose, composition, or medicinal
operation of some common drug; and all
the learning, method, and criticism, sometimes
discovered at these solemn debates, terminate
not unfrequently in the most simple
practice, by which the nurse is enjoined to
have recourse to the jeringa, and the patient
told he must drink “agua de pollo,”
or chicken-tea, until the return of the junta.
In former times such consultations were
called oftener than necessary, because a great
junta became a sort of ostentatious exhibition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in which all who could afford to cite
a group of doctors desired to imitate the
great and the wealthy.</p>

<p>A sample, on a little scale, of such fashionable
follies, is familiar to the Limenian in the
well-known local story of the two doctors,
who, for a month or more, daily met in consultation
at the house of a family in town,
where, as they retired to the supposed privacy
of a consulting-room, the one would clear his
throat, and ask the other, “<i>Come el enfermo
hoy?</i>”—May the patient eat to-day?—to
which the second doctor would reply, “<i>Como
no? si, comera.</i>”—Why not? yes, he shall
eat. Thus, day after day, began and ended
the consultation, as far at least as its topics
of discussion concerned the patient; while
the good old doctors spun out a regular allowance
of time before they rejoined the patient,
or his attendants, serenely to announce
the well-matured result of their conference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
A man of <i>nous</i>, accustomed to listen behind
the scenes, at length broke in upon their
consultation; and dismissed them one day
by paying to each his usual fee, and telling
them both how happy he was to find
that he now knew as much as themselves,
for that he could repeat as well as anybody,
“Come el enfermo hoy?—Como
no? si, comera.”</p>

<p>A medical junta in Lima is commonly
continued morning and evening, and from
day to day, till the patient is pronounced
to be out of danger. As the junta breaks
up after each separate meeting, it is customary
for the president of the meeting, or
one of the physicians, to say, as he leaves his
seat, “Vamos a consolar al enfermo,”—Let
us go to console the patient; and then all
the doctors present re-enter the patient’s
apartment to soothe and to console him; and
after this one of the number steps forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to lay down the regimen—“a dar el regimen”—agreed
upon in consultation, and
which one or more nurses and attendants
are now ready to receive from the mouth
of the physician. After the formality of a
junta is thought no longer necessary, it
often happens that, by wish of the patient
or his relatives, two or more of the medical
advisers return at separate hours, but by
mutual agreement, for several days, by way
of further security to the sick, or as a source
of satisfaction to his family.</p>

<p>After all the care possible bestowed on
the part of doctors, it often happens that,
when the patient recovers, San Antonio,
or any other saint after whom the individual
is named, has all the credit of the
cure; but, when the case is unprosperous,
then all the evil is ascribed to human
agency.</p>

<p>In Lima, as elsewhere, it will readily
enough be admitted in general terms that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
all must die; but regarding this proposition,
when death strikes any one in particular,
difficulties at once suggest themselves; for
the surviving friends are ever ready to assign
many reasons why they are quite sure the
deceased might have escaped, had it not
been for this or that physician that misunderstood
his malady. Hence it may be said
that it is only in well-regulated juntas,
and in public hospitals, that the people of
Lima are supposed to glide to their latter
end by fair and natural means. Upon this
subject we heard it remarked by a sagacious
native, “Should a gambler lose at a cock-fight,
he does not attribute the loss to any
fault in the cock, but to some trick done to
him; if a horse lose in a race, his owner
never acknowledges the cause of the failure
to be in the animal, but assigns it to some
accident thrown in his way: and surely,
when we know that on such comparatively
trivial occasions men thus talk and think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
it is but natural for them, in an affair of
such moment and interest as life itself, never
to believe that a friend or relative loses his
existence from any fault of his own, or any
defect in his organization, but rather that
his demise should be charged, as we see
it is, though often unjustly, on the blind
and stumbling ignorance, or unpardonable
carelessness and indifference of the physicians.”</p>

<p>One common consequence of this mode of
thinking is, that, by a single fatal case in
practice, all the former success of the practitioner
is overlooked, at least for a time;
from which it follows that various medical
advisers are sure to replace one another
often in those families where death is a frequent
visitor.</p>

<p>We seldom meet in families that shyness
or reserve in divulging bodily ailments which
can render them reluctant to change their
family physician; and no physician, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
specially entrusted with a patient, can be
sure that others of the profession do not, at
secret interviews, tamper with his peculiar
treatment. This baneful custom leads to
professional jealousies and mutual distrust.
We believe many families countenance it
from motives of consideration for the doctor
<i>ostensibly</i> in trust, whose self-love they propose
to spare by this clandestine practice,
when they think a more open manner of
proceeding would be repulsive to his feelings.
There is, however, another very obvious
reason which lends its influence to this furtive
system of visiting the sick; and it is, that
by this means the opinion of several advisers
may be had at comparatively little expense.
Should only two individuals be called to
meet at the bedside of the patient at an appointed
hour to consult on his case, the meeting
is a <i>bonâ fide</i> junta, and each member
of it is entitled to his four or four and a
half dollars; whereas the single visits are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
only valued at one dollar each, and such
detached visits are in many instances not
paid by the sick, but by the friends at
whose request the professional calls are
made. Here then is great economy; eight
opinions (and if the patient be poor, so that
he is only expected to pay a half dollar fee
for a detached visit, <i>sixteen opinions</i>) may be
procured for the standard price of two when
given in consultation; and custom, as well
as reason and prudence, require that several
opinions should be taken in cases of hazard
and difficulty.</p>

<p>Owing in a considerable degree to the
comparative poverty of the present times,
medical juntas are by no means so frequent
as they used to be; but yet it is a common
saying on serious occasions, where the assistance
of more than one medical adviser is
thought necessary, that more is seen by four
eyes than by two.—“<i>Mas se ve con cuatro ojos
que con dos.</i>” By multiplying skill according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to this rule, a score of eyes may be assembled
in one junta to search into the patient’s obscure
malady, so as to point out the cause
and the remedy; or, if there should be no
other alternative, let him die according to
rule.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Condition of Slave population, and its influence on the
family economy and moral sentiments of the European
race.</p>

</div>


<p>Such is the influence which slave domestics
exercise over the feelings and comfort of
private families, and, we would even add,
over the moral and physical features of the
community, that it would be impossible to
give a correct picture of the state of society
in Lima without first cursorily viewing the
condition of the slave population in Peru.</p>

<p>In article 152 of the Political Constitution
of the Republic of Peru, it is declared that
no one is born a slave in the republic, neither
does any one enter from other countries who
is not left free when he treads on Peruvian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
soil. Should any Peruvian be found guilty
of importing slaves into the republic for the
purposes of traffic, the constitution declares
that he shall be deprived of his rights of
citizenship. But the internal traffic of
slaves still continues, though it is confined
to buying and selling such slaves as existed
in the country before the war of independence
began, or to such of their offspring as
were born before the year 1820, when
Peru was no longer the acknowledged patrimony
of Spaniards. With respect to the
mere exterior appearance of negroes born in
Peru of African parents, it is observed that
they are influenced by the bleaching effects
which the climate of the Peruvian coast is
known to produce on the ruddy sons of our
northern climes who reside for any length of
time in Lima. The native negro therefore
is lighter in colour, and possessed of finer,
more expressive, and much more regular
features than the jet-black and lacerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
“Bozals” or African-born blacks, on whose
countenance and breast are commonly seen
deep and hideous scars that bespeak at once
their more barbarous origin and their foreign
importation.</p>

<p>The orderly discipline of the “Galpon,”
or slave-barracks, appears, from the acknowledgments
of the natives themselves, to have
been very creditable to the humanity of the
slave-holders in the days of Spanish sway over
them,—a time when slaves are said to have
shared in the felicity of their masters. Leniently
dealt with, and in the abundant fruition
of animal gratifications, they felt themselves
happy, and forgot that they were not free.</p>

<p>The patriot legislators have enacted that
it is illegal for any master to apply the whip
or scourge, “azote,” in chastising his slave.
The ordinary mode of punishment in the
capital is to send the offender for correction
to a “panaderia” or bakehouse, where his
labour is increased or mitigated according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
his conduct while there. In most ancient
families, who have yet preserved sufficient
fortune to allow them to keep up some retinue,
we find a number of slave attendants
whose progenitors served in the same family
of distinction for a long series of years; and
thus a mutual attachment has grown up
between the parties, that makes them view
each other with that sort of interest which
we observe between masters and old servants
at home. It is not unusual for a master on
his death-bed to reward the fidelity of a
faithful slave by granting him his liberty;
and we have witnessed some very touching
instances of gratitude shown by well-educated
white women towards those female
slaves, or, we might say, devoted friends, on
whose willing services and attention they
themselves often placed their confidence in
the hour of sickness or adversity. These
recollections are in our mind associated with
those amiable traits of human nature which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
unite the great family of mankind; but it
must be observed that from such instances,
particularly creditable to the character of
individuals, nothing can be argued in favour
of slavery as such, which never can be otherwise
than unjust and unchristian.</p>

<p>Since the triumphs of patriotism first
cheered the hopes of the people, since the
very slaves, intoxicated with aguardiente or
momentary enthusiasm, joined aloud in the
chants in praise of liberty, numberless families
in the capital have gradually sunk into
increasing poverty, of which a common consequence
is, that individuals who can boast
of the purity of their origin, or who, in
native phrase, count it no plebeian privilege
to say that their <i>four quarters</i> are Biscayan,
now find themselves reduced to lend out their
old domestic slaves on hire as a means of
support; the slaves being obliged to pay a
certain moderate proportion of their daily
wages or earnings to their proper owners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
A male slave, when thus hired out in Lima,
is understood to pay his owner one real, or a
sixpence, out of his day’s wages or earnings;
and women, when hired out as nurses, are
usually paid fifteen dollars a month; of
which they pay four dollars to their proper
owners, and the rest they may do what they
please with: others again go out as cooks,
or are employed as laundry-maids, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The few agricultural slaves yet left in the
country have usually allotted to them a
<i>tarea</i>, or daily task, so light and easy, as
far at least as we have had any opportunity
of knowing, that it is soon executed;
and whatever work any one of them does
over and above this daily task, he is paid
for as if he were a freeman. Were he indeed
to value his personal freedom, he could
thus secure it to himself by fair means, and
at the cost of moderate industry. A few
of the more ambitious of this class have
really availed themselves of so good an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to effect their own emancipation;
but in general the slave population in Peru
do not appear solicitous to change their circumstances,
nor are they very conscious of
anything abject in their condition. They
well know that they enjoy a degree of liberty
which they consider sufficient, and which
they sometimes are pleased to exercise to suit
their own convenience: for example, if you
are assisted by a slave, it is not unlikely that,
when least expected, he will tell you it is his
desire, and he demands it as his right, that
he be sold or transferred to a purchaser of
his own choice and finding; and, should he
once become restive, he is best got rid of
quickly, as until that is the case no more
good comes of him. If the servant should
be not a slave, but a dusky freeman of
slave descent, he is so accustomed to self-indulgence,
that he must daily have his own
hours of pleasure, whether his master will
or not; and, if found fault with, he replies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the usual ejaculation, “Quien quiere
matarse con trabajar?”—Who would kill
himself with toil?</p>

<p>Those again who rely on the assistance
of an Indian, (nominally free, though virtually
a slave, working for a mere maintenance
and some trifling gratuity,) reared up
from childhood in their own houses and for
their own particular service,—a very customary
thing to do,—are commonly, in the long
run, left in the lurch; for, when a good
opportunity offers, away starts the <i>cerrano</i>
or mountaineer, whether male or female, for
Guamanga, Guamantanga, or some such
mountain home. The Indian girl thus reared
in some private family is commonly very
useful until she attains the age of twelve
or fifteen, when she looks out for a mate,
with whom she can fly to the hills, to be
happy in a smoky hut, and on a llama-skin
couch; and the shrewd and quick-eyed
Indian boy, with head and hands to conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and execute, no sooner gets a little
insight into good service or some handicraft,
than he meditates upon and watches
the opportunity for escaping to his native
home, “mi tierra!” and, sooner or later,
he is sure to effect his object. Yet, notwithstanding
this disposition to desertion,
where an Indian does become personally
attached to his employer, which is not often,
his fidelity and constancy are allowed to be
unbounded.</p>

<p>The vexations so often caused by the
Indians among the class of their Spanish
employers, or white superiors, (who usually
expect more from this oppressed order of
citizens than they care to pay for,) gave
rise to the proverbial complaint against the
indigenous tribes:</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p class="center">“Mal con ellos; pejor sin ellos,”</p>

<p class="center">Bad with them; worse without them.</p>

</div>

<p>The ladies, or females of Spanish blood
in Lima, usually become mothers at too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
tender an age, and we think it is chiefly
on this account that they are commonly
found to be incapable of nursing with impunity;
and, if they persist in attempts at
nursing beyond what their constitution can
bear, they are peremptorily warned to desist
by the presence of symptoms that menace
a decline or consumption.</p>

<p>Hence most ladies in Lima are under the
necessity of employing black and brown
nurses, who are usually slaves either purchased
for milk-nurses or hired out for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The skin of the negro appears to be cooler
than that of the Indian or white race, and
this may possibly have been the origin of
the prevailing idea already alluded to, that
the milk of the negress is more cooling and
refreshing than that of the Indian woman,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
who, though in other respects a healthy and
proper person, is never considered eligible as
a milk-nurse, when in this character a negress
can be procured.</p>

<p>It unfortunately happens, however, that
the predilection thus shown for negresses
and those dark women who are nearest
allied to the negro race, frequently exposes
the white mother’s child to a series of evils,
such as imperfect nutrition, contamination
of blood, and permanent constitutional injury,
all originating in the peculiar circumstances
and individual character of milk-nurses;
of whom a single child may have
been so unfortunate as to have had as many
as half a dozen, and to have suffered successively
from the blemishes of each. When
the young Don, thus nurtured in the
very lap of bondage, comes to be fit for
school, he goes to, and comes from it, in
the company of a slave; and the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Miss, or Niña, who goes out to be educated,
is, on her way to and from her parents’
house, attended by a sort of dueña, or experienced
zamba. On the customary plea,
that the evils of life come early enough, children
of gentle blood, especially such as are
“rubios,” or fair-complexioned, are allowed
all manner of <i>gusto</i>, or indulgence; and in
the morning, before they set out for school,
they usually receive a real or medio,—sixpence
or threepence,—either as pocket-money, or as
a bribe to be obedient and to submit to be
taught. In this way expensive habits are
early acquired, and mere children made
to do what is right and proper from pecuniary
motives, rather than a laudable sense
of duty.</p>

<p>Reviewing the effects of a close social
union, from infancy upwards, between white
children and their slave companions, who
are seldom endowed with shame or modesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
we are led to remark that, without desiring
to make any insinuations against the natural
capacity for moral and intellectual improvement
observable among all the races of
mankind, or wishing in any degree to depreciate
the merit of individuals of pure or
mixed African and slave descent, we think
it may be truly affirmed, that even minds
of a naturally amiable and delicate bias,
when led habitually to accommodate themselves
to the grovelling feelings and propensities
of the more degraded portion of our
kind, undergo deterioration by degrees, and
slide into a participation of the qualities
of a baser nature, with which they inevitably
amalgamate their own. The proper
medium of domestic intimacy allowable between
masters and slaves, may be a nice
matter to determine with precision; but it
may be said in general, that in proportion
as this immediate intercourse may meliorate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the condition, and quicken the intelligence,
of the slave, it tends to lower the tone of
morality in that society where slavery is tolerated.
Thus, we doubt not, the standard
of morals is lowered, and we conceive
it may be owing to this very alloy of character
that, until very lately, the sheer
ruffian was seldom met with, even among
the lowest of the dark septs in the voluptuous
capital of Peru. Assassinations, it
must be owned, have been rather frequent
of late years, and these have been almost
always perpetrated with impunity; but there
is reason to believe that the agents concerned
in such atrocious crimes were in
many instances not sons of the soil, but outcasts
and fugitives from neighbouring states.
Money, not blood, is what the worst of the
dark native vagabonds of the coast are generally
in quest of; and he who does not offer
resistance when accosted by the robber, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
instead of armour, carries a few dollars or
a couple of doubloons for his ransom, may
nine times in ten be suffered to escape with
entire personal safety from the midst of the
most lawless marauders and dreaded highwaymen,
who are usually no other than renegade
slaves.</p>

<p>Persons of sufficiently mature age in
Lima never fail to acknowledge, and often
delight to tell us, that before the great revolution,
and during the tranquil period of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
own early recollections, their fellow-citizens
and countrymen were in general fair and
upright in their ordinary dealings; and that
good humour, happiness, and gaiety of heart
were inseparable from their frequent public
meetings and social recreations.</p>

<p>But this sound and amicable spirit, which
indeed appears to have diffused itself pretty
generally in the time of the Spanish dynasty,
we may trace as emanating from the many
estimable and courteous qualities of those
more enlightened Europeans, by whose superior
capacity and direction the then existing
order of society was so long and quietly
upheld in this and in other sections of the
New World. The past state of things was
nevertheless faulty in many respects. It
involved an uncontrolled indulgence in sensual
gratification, though the memory of many
a disappointed patriot likes to dwell on it
as on the flowery retrospect of his happiest
days. But Lima is no longer a garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of roses, or a bower of delight. One
day, in speaking of the change to the
worse that the revolution had brought
about in the social system of his country,
a venerable old man remarked, “Formerly
there was a heart to feel, and a hand to
give; but now they have left us neither
friendship nor pity: you find not whom to
trust; and men, without regard to right or
justice, keep all to themselves with the close
unyielding grasp of the ape when she clasps
her young to her bosom.”</p>

<p>An unbounded love of superficial display
engages the minds of the people so fully as
to have superseded, to a great extent, active
benevolence, and sterling, honourable dealing
between man and man; and we must
confess that the yet inexperienced creoles,
left to themselves, show, in the management
of their own affairs, slender political discretion
and no shining public virtue.</p>

<p>But yet, as a whole, the Peruvians, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
whose manifold faults very great allowances
should be made, have, in an eminent degree,
the redeeming qualities of soft, attractive
manners, and a mild, prepossessing address.
These agreeable characteristics, not so frequently
as could be wished associated with
a manly openness and frankness of mind,
sometimes serve, in the present evil times,
as a ready cloak to exclude the ken of
those whom they are willing to deceive.</p>

<p>If these secluded people, too long accustomed
to servitude and ease during the
luxurious dynasty of their European masters,
were once induced—which, under good
moral management, they easily might be,—to
make honesty and industry more prevalent
virtues than they are at present among the
bulk of the population, then they might
realize, more largely than they have yet
done, the advantages of that unsettled freedom,
which, with feelings of pardonable exultation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
they pride themselves in possessing;
and, with such an amendment on their moral
features, their richly varied country, with all
its natural superiorities and improvable resources,
might soon be transformed into an
earthly elysium. But the germ of true political
liberty must be better cultivated than
it has yet been among them, and protected
by a steady, disinterested, and patriotic government,
before the soil can be made to
throw out its latent luxuriance, or generous
and noble virtues freely unfold themselves
in the heads and hearts of a newly independent,
uninstructed, and heterogeneous population.</p>

<p>The common race of Spaniards from old
Spain, who established themselves and reared
families in Peru, appear to have been,
as we formerly signified, men of strict commercial
integrity, scarcely requiring written
obligations or acknowledgements in their pecuniary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
transactions one with the other;
they are reported to have been friendly and
charitable, always ready to assist a poor
adventurer from the old country, or a needy
friend, whenever he presented himself.</p>

<p>The houses of the affluent teemed with idle
domestics and laughing loiterers, whose
coarse merriment bespoke contentment and
plenty; and the beggar, who sat in the back-court
and corridor (the walls of which are
still beautified with painted flowers and landscapes)
to enjoy the cool of the artificial
fountain, or who rested himself on the
benches of the tesselated porchway, laughing
with the merry fellows that were about him,
felt not the miseries of pauperism; for, wherever
the Limenian mendicant seated himself,
there he was happy, and partook cheerfully
of the abundant surplus from the rich
man’s table, which was liberally bestowed
on the poor.</p>

<p>But, generally speaking, delicacy of sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
or refinement of education did not
belong to the Spanish colonists; and though
they acquired wealth by their moderate industry,
reared costly edifices and churches,
endowed convents and monasteries, and paid
for numberless masses; though they befriended
the poor, and filled their welcome
guest’s cup to overflowing in a land of milk
and honey; yet, be it spoken with candour,
their <i>summum bonum</i> seems to have been
something like a good Mussulman’s paradise.</p>

<p>The natives of the country still avow, that
though the Spaniard, who used to come to
their shores as an adventurer soon to be
incorporated into their domestic circle, was
seldom a polished or intellectual character,
nevertheless he was usually a man of integrity
and some industry, or, to use their
own words, “brusco, pero recto y trabajador.”
Besides, the women, whom we in general
allow to be good judges in every rank of
life, continue to bear witness that the Spaniard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
makes a good husband and a kind
father of a family,—“el Espanol es buen
marido y buen padre de familia.” But, to
merit this encomium from the fair sex on
the shores of the Pacific, let it be borne in
mind that austere virtue and severe self-denial
are not always expected or required in the
husband.</p>

<p>Those educated foreigners who frequent
the rounds and “tertulias” of Limenian
good company,—which we take as the best
criterion of refinement in that country,—have
had occasion to regret, that women
of the most elegant manners, ladylike mien,
and unimpeached character, are despoiled of
no small share of the outward illusion of
their charms, and appear to lose much of
the moral loveliness of their sex, by an
unconscious licence of speech, that cannot
fail to appear faulty in the opinion of those
to whom long habit has not yet rendered the
style familiar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>We have pleasure in bearing our humble
evidence in favour of the great pains, and
cost, to which mothers now put themselves
in educating their daughters; and it is incontrovertible,
that the rising generation are
about to come on the stage of active life,
with many advantages of instruction which
were not enjoyed by their parents. But,
granting it to be true, that these interesting
young ladies may have considerable advantages
over their predecessors in the knowledge
of French, geography, music, a little
drawing, and a chaster fashion of dancing,
still, we are apprehensive, that in more humble
and useful domestic education not a little
is wanting: and this important defect, we
conceive, is not to be remedied by expensive
teachers, or by the routine of boarding-schools;
but, if we mistake not, by good
example at home. To improve the domestic
education in the female part of the
community, it would be necessary to detach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
young ladies as much as possible from
the customary attendance of old favourite
“zambas;” who, there is much reason to
believe, teach them at an early age to pry
into the private weaknesses of their seniors,
and excite in their quick, comprehensive
minds a degree of attention and curiosity
which, when indiscreetly called forth, seldom
fail to bias their inclination to vices
that may on some occasions be deemed
hereditary; and thus open a door to a series
of indulgences which, in the long-run,
prove the bane of their own ill-sought
happiness, as well as the wreck of many a
fond parent’s hopes, too blindly placed on a
daughter left to the daily tutorship of intriguing
domestics.</p>

<p>The ladies when young, and long before they
become marriageable, are taught to anticipate
their own omnipotence at fifteen, which little
girls of seven or eight years of age already
reckon to be the approaching era of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
perfect felicity; for the Spaniards say “No
hay fea de quince,”—All are fair at fifteen.
There is also among these gifted women,
whose superiority, as a body, over their own
countrymen is always admitted, a great
“esprit de corps,” so that the greatest sinner
among them is never left without a
gentle voice to plead her cause, and palliate,
when she cannot exculpate, a sister’s
errors.</p>

<p>This forgiving system runs through every
class and rank, from the highest to the
lowest; but it is in the lofty circles that
its influence is most worthy of particular
notice. No one ventures to throw the
first stone at the unfortunate; and there
insensibly arises a gradation of vices and
virtues, dove-tailing into each other so as to
constitute a social whole, wherein the different
degrees of moral deviation are all
shaded by an overflowing charity. Pleasure
and vice are nearly allied, and unhappily he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
who assumes the clerical habit and tonsure is
not, in his own person, always a stranger to
the voluptuous enjoyments of those around
him; and the example of the man who
rules the conscience of the people,—who
grants them absolution, and allows them
indulgences,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>—will naturally be imitated:
hence the indulgence of public opinion as
regards individual and private character in
Peru.</p>

<p>The slow and partial administration of
justice is loudly complained of by those
whose affairs require them to frequent
courts of law in the Peruvian capital. The
turbulent independence of the bad and disorderly,
uncontrolled by any active and
faithful police, is every day increasing, and
already puts justice at defiance. The impudence,
ill-acquired pecuniary influence,
and intrigue of the false-hearted and boasting
patriot, are daily seen to assume the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
embroidered insignia of “un benemerito de
la patria!”—an honour which only in equity
belongs to that rare character—the genuine
patriot, who knows how to sacrifice his private
convenience to the public good. The
judges are often left without pecuniary
means consistent with their honourable calling,
because their salaries are not duly
paid by the government; and if, under
these circumstances, the balance of justice
be disturbed in its equilibrium, the blame
must not be all laid to the charge of
those public functionaries who are the appointed
ministers of the laws. The truth
is, that, for a considerable time back, the
sums that entered the national treasury were
too scanty to support the pageantry of military
array, together with the accumulated
expences of a destructive and demoralizing
warfare; and the pecuniary embarrassments
arising from these circumstances, involved in
their consequences some drawbacks in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
civil administration of justice. But another
popular cause, and that to which we would
desire to draw the attention of the reader,
for the unequal distribution of justice, is by
common consent allowed to be, that in the
best, as even now in the worst of times, the
fair sex in Lima have enjoyed, from date
immemorial, a more than regal prerogative,
which the convulsions that effected what
is called their political freedom, have in no
essential particular obliterated or changed.
It is called Empeño.</p>

<p>This tacitly constitutional instrument of
clemency, although in the hands of women
naturally inclined to mercy, may, when misguided,
operate against the vital interests of
the community; and by it the true ends of
legislative enactments may, from time to
time, be frustrated. This prerogative is
put in practice especially by certain genteel-looking
young women, who are neither married
nor single, but who, in the language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the indulgent matrons of the country, are
allowed to be, though not married, highly
honourable and gifted,—“No es casada, pero
muy honrada, muy prendada:” and a lady
of this quality seldom loses favour, or a
good place in society, so long as she has a
<i>calesa</i> or carriage in Lima, and a <i>rancho</i> or
bathing-lodge in Chorrillos. Let us now
suppose that this lady, attired in her national,
or rather Limenian, dress of saya and manto,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
desires either to plead some advantage or
indulgence for another, or a favour more
particularly for herself,—and that for this
purpose she employs the blandishments and
flow of persuasive language at her command.
The gentleman, thus softly assailed by so
eloquent and attractive a being, unwisely
listens until he is entirely at his magician’s
bidding. This spell is what is vulgarly
meant by the gigantic and overgrown
prerogative termed in Peru empeño. But
we must not forget to mention, that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
ascendant power is very commonly promoted
by a certain spiritual influence, in
which both married and single partake,—namely,
the sacred relation between god-fathers
and god-mothers, the well-known
“compadres y comadres” of that sunny
land; and it will be at once perceived
that an influence so remarkable in the
ladies as this, which enables them, during
their good pleasure, to deprive men of free-will,
must have wide practical application,
and be productive of great good or evil in
that country, where it confessedly extends
its sway to bench and altar, senate, palace,
and camp. No old stager in Lima hears of
a political or domestic altercation, or of any
serious movement that causes a stir and
sensation in the city, but he immediately
inquires what woman can be at the bottom
of this <i>bullanga</i> or hubbub; and if the affair
should happen to concern himself, his friends,
or political party, he does not long sit at ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
until he finds out who that woman is, or
discovers where the spiritual alliance rests,
where dwells the comadre that rules the
order of the day.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The Peruvian highland girls have an
ingenious way of contriving for themselves
compadres, without the necessary interference
of the priest, merely by sending the
gentleman, whom any one of them in particular
may desire to honour, a sweet cake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
made into the form of a doll, which they
call “guawa,” the Indian name for baby.
This offspring of a good-humoured regard
which they desire should become mutual,
they nicely dress, and accommodate on a
couch made from a selection of the fresh
flowers of the season, and forward it with their
kindest wishes (con muchisimas expresiones),
under their now adopted name of comadre,
to the person on whom by this gracious
act of partiality they confer the confidential
title, expecting by his acceptance a return
of the attentions and courtesy of the real
compadre. On the coast, again, (in the capital,)
on the anniversary of a lady’s birth-day,
or saint’s day, celebrated in merry parties
encouraged to assemble by the joint allurements
of music, dancing, cooling repasts, and
all that can render such meetings attractive,
the drawing-room may be said to be converted
into a flower-garden by the attention of
compadres, comadres, and friends, who vie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with each other in sending presents of fine
flowers, sweet preserves, and other gifts;
and, at the annual return of these joyful
meetings, the friends of the family, and of
the individual who is the object of the compliments
of the day, have the best opportunity
of expressing their friendship, by adding to
the ornaments of a young lady’s toilet, or
presenting her with any delicate mark of
personal regard.</p>

<p>These meetings, not overlooked in the
humblest dwellings, are seen to best advantage
in the handsome “<i>quadra</i>,” or
tertulia-room of the wealthy, where the
large chandeliers are well reflected by
spacious mirrors, in which are seen multiplied
the groups of happy faces, to the
delight of the party, all pleased with one
another. Here and there are Guamanga
baskets of filigree texture laden with spiced
and perfumed fruits, sometimes ornamented
with delicate threads of gold and silver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fancifully twined from peg to peg of the
spice fixed in the fruit. Among them, too,
are usually golden apples,—viz. apples coated
with gold leaf,—many sweet fruits imbedded
in aroma, and the sweetly-scented
cheremolla or cheremoya, and orange blossoms,
which are peculiarly welcome to the
guests when distributed from the hands of
the hostess, or her engaging daughters.</p>

<p>We may here observe, in passing, that
handing a flower to a forenoon visitor, who,
if a polished gentleman, accompanies his
verbal salutation by raising his hand softly
to his heart, is only a customary mark of
polite attention, quite in character with
the complacent manners and natural taste
of the Limenian ladies, in this respect favoured
by their balmy climate, in which
odoriferous fruits and flowers are always
within reach: and on leaving their house
they almost invariably besprinkle their
visitors with perfumes, and thus send them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
away <i>redolent</i> of hospitality. And while
their corridors, in which they frequently
swing in their hammocks, or enjoy the
<i>siesta</i>, are scented with flower-gardens, and
their “patios,” or courts, with roses and
jessamine, sweet perfumes, and fragrant
herbs are frequently used in their principal
bed-chamber, when it is found convenient,
for the sake of cheering the sick, to
receive friends into this apartment, which
is usually very gorgeously furnished, and
communicates with the drawing-room or
<i>quadra</i>. Our professional avocations have
afforded us an intimate opportunity to know,
and we feel a peculiar pleasure in proclaiming
it, that it is by the bedside of sickness
(where men are exceedingly helpless without
the aid of the softer sex, at once more patient
and serene, more dexterous and endearing
in their assistance,) that the Limeña,
be her rank, birth, or pretensions
what they may, is seen to greatest advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Here the humblest and most faulty
of these comforters shows the native goodness
of her disposition, and is seen to rise
superior to the drawbacks of her education,
manifesting the angelic power of her sex to
soothe pain and cheer the broken-hearted, by
the exercise of that blessed charity which
covereth a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>It is curious to notice that among the
white women of Lima there are no menials,
though they are subject to many of
the privations and humiliations of poverty;
but, a poor girl of unmixed Spanish blood,
though of lowly birth, feels, however destitute
in her circumstances, the impulse of
what she deems nobility within her; and
at nothing do her prejudices more strongly
recoil, than at the idea of becoming the
wife of a man of African or slave descent.</p>

<p>Comely countenances,—above all, a bright
and beautiful eye,—and pretty figures,
with an inimitably graceful walk, constitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the common inheritance of the
European race, who, in their own forms,
partake of the softness and fineness of the
climate in which they were brought into
being. These are, in common with their
tawny and darker countrywomen, extremely
attentive to the public and outward ordinances
of their showy religion, which must
strike every one with a feeling of solemnity
as, at the stroke of a bell at twilight, every
human being engages in one common act of
public devotion. They retain the common
Catholic spirit of pious display, fasting, and
penance; the same faith in the efficacy of
saintly images and influences; the same reliance
on priestly absolution and indulgences;
but they do not cherish the cruelty
or stern religion of their ancestors, whose
ardent zeal planted the cross on the now
mouldering ruins of Pachacamac.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
little versed in book-information, they are
usually gifted with natural acuteness and
intelligence; are seldom quite ignorant of
the ways of the world, even when educated in
convents; are hardly ever so overcome by their
tender feelings, or so blind to their worldly
interests, as to fall into the folly of a genuine
love-marriage; and they are never at a loss
for a sagacious observation or pertinent reply.
They are indulgent to human passion
and weakness; are agreeable, sometimes
fascinating companions; and never fail to
leave the <i>buen mozo</i>, (the good-looking young
man,) if not delighted with them, at least
highly pleased with himself. Their conversation
is sprightly and unembarrassed; and
though particularly indulged and caressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
from childhood, accustomed to flattery and
fond of admiration, they are as free from
obtrusive levity and affectation of manner,
as from blushing timidity or cold reserve;
their filial love is the admiration of foreigners;
and, when blessed with good husbands,
they are faithful and affectionate wives.</p>

<p>Nothing in Lima can strike the attention
of a stranger, who understands their language,
more than the propriety and fluency
with which serving-people express their
thoughts, and this they commonly do with
an agreeable seasoning of the ease and manner
of the higher classes; a fact, no doubt,
attributable to much native ability on their
own part, and to their having been brought
up on a footing of great familiarity with
their superiors. This recommendatory trait
in the humblest ranks of the community is,
we regret, fast giving way to the intrusive
manners of the unrestrained and rising aristocracy
of a mongrel brood,—a dusky and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
bronzed brotherhood, whose very complexion
indicates an incapacity to blush as apparent,
at first sight, as among the white race used
to be the long-honoured badge of the proud
Spanish lineage,—the “sangre azul!” blue
blood!—so called, by the inferior races, in
consideration of the hue of the veins rising
to view under the delicate tissue of a pure
white skin.</p>

<p>Wit, not unknown among the white
women, is a general attribute of the mestizo
and zambo septs, as well male as female.
These people of colour are too much
addicted to sarcasm, and too fond of the
ludicrous and fantastical. When in a bilious
or choleric mood, they are outrageously
passionate; but then, with <i>chicha-piña</i> (fermented
juice of the pine-apple), and <i>nieve</i>
(ice or iced-water), they soon drown or
freeze their fury, and restore to themselves
equanimity and mirth. Instances of death
from impetuous gusts of passion are, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
believe, rare among them; though we
have had occasion to hear of some such,
and we have witnessed severe nervous ailments
that arose from the turbulent emotion
of their savage anger. Such mixed
castes are remarkable for a great deal of
what is by themselves called “<i>broma</i>,”—a
facetious kind of bantering, with noisy fun
and sensual dalliance, which is most displayed
at their “<i>jarranas</i>,” or merry meetings:
they like the theatre, and they are
passionately fond of bull-fights, cock-fights,
religious processions, and that sort of song
and music which inflame the passions and
deprave the heart,—their feasts too often
degenerate into debauchery, and their merriment
into obscenity.</p>

<p>Boys of pure Spanish parentage or descent,
in Lima, are usually animated and
intelligent, like their sisters; but, as their
bodily powers approach to maturity, their
attention is engrossed with frivolous pleasures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
which seem to enervate the mental faculties,
and stint and vitiate their future expansion.
It is, therefore, not unusual for
hopeful boys to become childish and fickle,
silly and fatuous men. The latter imbecility
of mind we observe with striking frequency
in the families of the suppressed nobility.</p>

<p>Those very few well-tempered spirits that
have outgrown every obstacle to their full
mental developement, have that inborn thirst
after knowledge which even knowledge itself
cannot quench; for, the more they learn,
the more they aspire to know; and these
men, with little external incitement to forward
or nurture their literary tastes and
pursuits, are like those plants on arid land,
which only require a few fleeting showers to
quicken their energies, develope their form,
and unfold their beauty. Such choice persons
are the delight of their friends, and worthy
of that better state of society for which they
daily sigh, as they see the best laws and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
institutions of their country trampled upon
by military despots, whose nod they must
obey, while they say in their hearts, “Vetitum
est sceleri nihil!”</p>

<p>On the 24th of June, (Dia de San Juan,)
all Lima annually assemble along the windings
of the “Great Alamada,” and between
orangeries now prettily laden with fruit,
to the romantic mountain recess of “Amencaes,”
only about one mile from town, and
beautifully adapted for pleasure-grounds, if
only supplied with water, which it might
have at some expense. This spot commands
a fine view of the capital, with its towering
spires; of wide fields, innumerable orchards,
the Rimac, and the fine lagoon at its mouth;
the island of San Lorenzo, and the shipping
at Callao; and it has, in its back-ground,
a set-off in the acclivities newly
clothed with vivid vegetation, among numerous
crags and many a ridge and chasm.
Here, on the day of San Juan,—a day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
festivity and joy,—men, women, and children,
of all ranks, all ages, and all colours
and occupations, meet. Mirth is the object
of one and all. Their horses, their asses,
and even their own persons, are adorned
in their best manner; and the rational as
well as the irrational members of the ever-moving
crowd are bedecked with the flower
of Amencaes taken from the favourite clefts
and nooks of these hills. In this place
there are tents and sheds, that supply seats
and refreshment for those who love the
thoughtless and bawling mirth of the “jarrana.”
There is at this exhibition a dunning
confusion of musical discord kept up
by drumming, piping, shouting, harping, and
guitaring, singing, laughing, and dancing;
but no fighting. Here too we may see the
popular “paseo,” or promenade, of the “<i>chuchumecas</i>,”
(women of immoral character,)
who mingle freely and good-humouredly
with the crowd, to the infinite amusement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of the multitude. The national taste is on
this, as on other occasions of festivity, eminently
displayed by the loud and simultaneous
laugh, or “<i>carcajada</i>,” of cheering
voluptuaries when the samaqueca—a favourite
dance—is exhibited in a free and
masterly style.</p>

<p>The periodical rides and picnics of the
Limenians to Las Huacas, Surco, and Lurin,
are now dwindling away into neglect, as
there is neither money nor public tranquillity
for such happy scenes of customary
gaiety. Carnival, with them, has lost its
spirit; the <i>Noche Buena</i>, or Christmas-eve,
is deprived of much of its revelry; and
all that in their customs was most alluring
and glittering is rapidly withering and dying
away.</p>

<p>We may now, not unfrequently, observe
more disposition to indulge in the gloomy
and silent stillness of the “<i>duelo</i>,” or formal
condolence for the dead, than in the hilarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of the golden times of these merry-making
people, who were for generations most happy
in the unconsciousness of defects, and in
the conviction that no people on earth were
superior to themselves in knowledge and
civilization.</p>

<p>In all parts of the world there are criminally
selfish and unprincipled men; and in
Peru there may be found a set of rogues, called
“<i>Pillos</i>,” rendered more numerous and troublesome
from the circumstances of the times.
Of these the capital presents two kinds, which
has led to the distinction of “pillo” and “pillo-fino.”
The first is a very common and plausible
sort of rogue; but the latter is, as the
name implies, a more refined cheat, not unfrequently
enticed from distant parts by the
fame of the numerous attractions of Lima, the
paralysis of the laws, and consequent facility
of escaping chastisement. The clink of hard
dollars and doubloons, shoveled into “<i>talegas</i>,”
or money-bags, and again thrown open at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
gambling-table, are such sounds as are sure
to allure the pillo-fine to that promiscuous
society of Limenian gamblers, where the precious
coin usually finds its way into the
hands of the crafty. Whatever be the land of
this animal’s nativity, he is but a vampire,—a
human blood-sucker; but the simple pillo
is a very different character, always plausible
and pliable, an every-day and common-place
member of society, who sponges on his neighbour,
and whom all Englishmen courted
for their generosity are sure to encounter.
The ultimatum of this person’s milky adulation
and very smiling policy is to procure a
loan of money; and when he asks “plata
prestada,” or money on loan, of any one,
he assures that person, that applying to
him is the greatest proof he can offer of
his own friendly confidence and regard for
the individual; but, while he is lavish of
compliment, he takes care not to express
his secret purpose, namely, never to reimburse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
whatever in this way he may hope to
clutch.</p>

<p>It is a trite saying with the Spaniard,—“Es
bueno conocer el amigo sin perderlo,”
that is, It is well to know a professed friend,
but not to lose him; and this will be found,
like most Spanish adages, to convey in actual
life a lesson of practical wisdom. The
common pillo, of whom we take notice,
never thinks the less of you for giving him
a polite refusal; and, by so doing, you act in
the spirit of the above saying, and preserve
both your friend and your money; for, when
civilly refused, he in good nature leaves you,
and proceeds forthwith in search of some
less wary dupe, and thinks to himself as he
departs from you, “Ya este sabe,”—This
one is up to our tricks.</p>

<p>Though Peru be a land of gold and silver,
yet nowhere are the precious metals in
greater requisition than in Lima, where the
scarcity of circulating capital is shown by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
revolting dealings of the common usurer, who
extorts from the victims of his cupidity two
or three per cent. a month on the advances
he makes; and the current and regular rate
of interest in that country is one per cent. a
month, or twelve per cent. a year.</p>

<p>The “plata,” or money, covers more delinquencies
than charity itself; hence we
hear such expressions as these: “Nada es
mala que gana la plata,” viz. Nothing is bad
that wins the money. “Bien, le costo su
plata!”—Very well, (what is it to us?) it
cost him his money! “Porque no tener su
gusto cuando le cuesta la plata?”—Why not
have his pleasure when it costs him the money?—as
if money, forsooth, could annihilate
the moral turpitude of sinful enjoyment.</p>

<p>We cannot give the reader a better idea of
the popular ethics of Peru in the present
day, than in the words of a friend long resident
in the country, who said that Peru
had the advantage over every other country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
he had seen,—that in it “no one need ever
be put out of countenance for anything he
can say or do.” By so broad a statement as
that conveyed in the expression now cited,
we would only desire to represent the bad
state of moral feeling prevalent among the
bulk of a people not long since let loose to
follow their own unrestrained wishes; without
thereby meaning to deny the fact, that,
in Lima more particularly, we often find
that good natural dispositions and obliging
manners do in no small degree supply, in
the ordinary intercourse of life, the place
of higher principle. And yet more: we
would honourably except from this general
description many individual examples
of eminent virtue to be met in Peruvian
society; striking instances of disinterested
friendship and kindness (of which the
writer himself has more than once been the
favoured object); and the most generous,
amiable, and praiseworthy bearing, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
we have seen displayed by them in their
domestic and social relations.</p>

<p>If we consider all things in the circumstances
of the Peruvians, their story from
first to last must awaken an interest in the
mind of every inquirer into their past and
present state, rather than dispose him to censure
them indiscriminately for their errors.
We may indeed wonder not to find fewer
good qualities among them; and, on the other
hand, not to see the fiercer passions that utterly
brutalize human nature, and agitate
every corner of society, more called into action
among a medley of ignorant and discordant
castes, passing without adequate preparation
from one extreme of government to
another, and from one civil broil into another
of greater confusion and misrule.</p>

<p>But, as we have already had occasion to
mention, there is among the entire mass of
the people a natural aptness to please by a
happy address; and no one can witness the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
external graces of the more enlightened and
better classes, who are daily engaged in their
customary rounds of social and courteous
attentions, without desiring that these qualities,
at least, should survive the overthrow of
whatever is pernicious to a healthy state of
society.</p>

San Lorenzo.—New cemetery, and Latin inscription for the

</div>


<p>Among a people who suffer so large a
privation of moral discipline as the Peruvians,
we naturally look for a corresponding
prevalence of religious prejudices. Some
years ago, when we lived in one of the
most delightful climates in the interior of
Peru, we were greatly annoyed by our
neighbours of the two beautiful villages
Ambo and Tomay-quichoa. The inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the former would insist that we
drove from the estate of Andaguaylla, upon
which we resided, the worshipful saints, (little
painted images dressed in gaudy rags,) and
withdrew the workmen, or “yanacones,”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
from their little gods and religion. It was
not till after we were accused by the alcalde
of Ambo of being a kind of demon or goblin,
that the people of the estate were scared
into horror and desertion; or that we found
out, through the kindness of our Spanish
major-domo, that the alarmed men, women,
and children on the estate had over-night
rescued the saints from supposed danger,
by piously carrying them away to a town
about four leagues distant. Next morning
we were left with only one workman; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
he, being an old and maimed soldier, had
but one hand.</p>

<p>This wanton and unjust attack took a
legal form, and was parried off by legal
measures with the timely interposition of
that enlightened and benevolent citizen of
the world, Doctor Don Antonio de Valdizan,
himself a counsellor of state, a patron of learning,
and one of the enterprising miners, and
illustrious men of Peru. After this fray was
finally settled in our behalf, the alcalde persecutor
became our avowed and steady friend.
But, on the other hand, the mestizos of
Tomay-quichoa, nettled at the failure of the
Ambinos, allowed us, with their usual malicious
forethought, to go to great expense
in fencing, building, and cultivating sugar-cane
and other productions, before they
showed their determination, without any provocation
given by us, to baffle our labours,
and ruin our fortune, by appropriating to
their own use the water for irrigating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
fields under crop, thus annihilating the
young plantations.</p>

<p>We remonstrated against their unfair proceedings,
but to no purpose. They fabricated
false accusations, and involved us reluctantly
in a law-suit of two years’ continuance,
which, to the honour of the judge
of the district, the learned and respected
Dr. Mata, was ultimately terminated by an
equitable sentence.</p>

<p>These good people believed we were but
Jews, whom the Spaniards greatly abominate;
and they conceived that, if they did not get
rid of our neighbourhood in time, other
Englishmen, and therefore, as they ignorantly
supposed, other Jews, would settle there after
us; and by proceeding to disgust us with the
place, and scare us away in due season,
they acted in the spirit of the proverb, “El
prevenido nunca es vencido,”—The wary is
never foiled. But it is a subject of deep
interest to reflect on the practical example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
thus afforded of the working of that sovereign
maxim, “No faith with heretics.” We
here see, that although a perverted sense of
religion did not extinguish the perception
of an obvious right, yet it overcame the
sense of wrong towards the imagined Jew,
and in this respect suppressed the moral
feeling of equity.</p>

<p>Such banefully erroneous views must gradually
give way before the spreading light
of civilization, and a more extended international
intercourse. The bad moral effect
of seeing men, influential and respected while
living, consigned to the indignity of a canine
grave when dead, cannot but be perceived
and felt by the surviving friends and countrymen
of the deceased, whose religious persuasions
are distinct from those of the people
of the land in which they are sojourners.</p>

<p>We may mention, that the first English
gentleman’s remains we were called upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
to accompany to an unhallowed burying-place,
were those of one who died in an inland
city remarkable for the hospitality and kindness
of its inhabitants; and, after answering
a few questions regarding the religious creed
of the deceased, the price of the interment
was settled, we think, at fifty dollars, and
then the good-natured bishop, with a degree
of liberality seldom exercised towards dissenters
from the Romish ritual in Catholic
countries, yielded his sanction to let the
corpse have Christian burial. But, subsequently
to this permission, a mob was collected
in the night, and the body was cast out
from the church to the middle of the street,
where our obliging friend Don Mariano Sanches
told us it lay. On the following morning,
in a city where humanity was subdued
by the ugly suggestions of superstition,
there were only two good Samaritans.
These gave their attendance at the stranger’s
funeral, when the only two or three Britons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
at that time in the place accompanied the
body outside the city, to find it a grave under
the shelter of an orangery, where its mouldering
bones could not by any chance come into
contact with those of the pious agitators, who
would fain persuade themselves that, while
they live in harmony with the living heretic,
the mere sight of the worm that nibbles at
his interred remains is quite sufficient to endanger
their own eternal condition.</p>

<p>In the capital of the republic a better
example is at length given. Through the
meritorious exertions of the British Consul-general,
B. H. Wilson, Esq. the Peruvian
government have ceded to the English a
proper piece of cemetery-ground<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> at Bella
Vista, an agreeable and convenient situation
between Lima and the port of Callao. Formerly
all the English, not Roman Catholics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
who died in the capital or port, were interred
in the barren island of San Lorenzo,
where the bodies were exposed to the insults
of the most vile of mankind,—miscreant
convicts confined to the island for crimes
that expel them from the society of honest
men, and who believe that the English heretic,
like the ancient Peruvian pagan, must
needs have laid with him in the grave instruments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
or utensils of his avocation while
living; and, therefore, they are led to expect
that, our English merchant’s grave must be
a place of deposit for a full share of those
dollars he was seen always to handle, and to
ship away in boxes to his native land. These
outcasts were made to feel their own superiority,
if not while in chains or in the
galley, at least prospectively in their own
cypress-shaded Pantheon, over the wealthiest,
worthiest, and most respectable foreigners
in their land, who, at the close of life, they
might believe, exchanged situations with
themselves,—that is, were sent in perpetuity
to the arid and leafless San Lorenzo, while
they themselves would be conveyed and suffered
to rest in honoured ground until the
last day. Let the worst befal them,—should
they come to die on the “banquillo,” (a rude
stool on which the criminal is placed at the
hour of military execution,) yet they are not
at the last discouraged like the stranger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Protestant. They have the aid of the priest
when going to execution; and, when gone,
their carnal remains may rest in sanctified
earth. There will not probably be wanting
on such occasions some godmother <i>mas fea que
la noche</i>,—more ugly than night,—or some
friend, who will remember the necessities of
the departed highwayman whose days were
closed in the Plaza, and will charitably pay
the needy friar’s mass (value one dollar) to
extricate his soul from perdition.</p>

<p>Our Consul-general, ever zealous in the
discharge of his public duties, not only
saw the inconvenience to his own countrymen,
but the evil result of the former
mode of interment in the island of San
Lorenzo, and the great disadvantage that
British subjects laboured under in having
no place of public worship according to the
forms of their own national church. These
evils he endeavoured to counteract by procuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the grant of a cemetery as mentioned;
and by having church-service read at the
Consulate-general every Sunday, as is done
by captains and commanders in such of Her
Majesty’s vessels of war as have no chaplains
on board them.</p>

<p>By this arrangement the most incredulous
or prejudiced Peruvians have an opportunity
of knowing that our Consul-general,
and such of his countrymen as do not neglect
the public homage offered at the Consulate
to the Creator, do really feel an interest
beyond the grave, and have a hope
in Heaven as well as the deluded vulgar,
who long believed (and the absurdity seems
to have been inculcated as a political engine
of some power by those who must have
known better,) that the English were but a
species of the ourang-outang, with tails like
the lower animals; and consequently it was
quite plain, on the alleged evidence of comparative
anatomy, that their ultimate destination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
could not be higher than that of the
beasts that perish.</p>

<p>The name of Drake, and the famous treasure-ship
Caca-fuego, are now forgotten;
but we are assured that in Payta the name
of Anson is associated with sacrilegious recollections,
and is mentioned by the lower
class of natives with details that awaken
feelings very hostile to our countrymen.
At this sea-port, on the northern shores of
Peru, on a certain festival and anniversary-day,
when the image of the Virgin Mary
is taken out in procession, we are told that
it is shown with a patch of red wax on the
neck, marking the wound once inflicted in
this part by a sabre-blow from some disorderly
sailor of Anson.</p>

<p>An amiable and well-informed Limeña,
in whose house many of the <i>literati</i> daily
meet, has laughed heartily at the good old
times, when she related that, when a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
girl, (and she is not yet more than middle-aged,)
neither she herself, nor her playmates,
ventured to approach a certain English
sailor-boy without holding up their hands
and making the sign of the cross with the
fore-finger and thumb. This lady’s mother
took a great interest in the sailor-boy, seeing
that he was fair and handsome; and
greatly regretted his not being a Christian,
an expression by which she meant, of course,
a Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>Some recollections of ancient feuds may
still co-operate, in a greater or less degree,
with religious prejudices to keep up no very
warm feeling towards the English as a people;
but it is gratifying to think that even
on the distant shores of the Pacific, and
among the glens of the Andes, there is a
growing intelligence that tends rapidly to
dissipate such unfriendly feelings. A nearer
acquaintance with the English character,
the insensible but gradual progress of knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the general extension and assimilating
tendency of commerce, the softening effects
of time, and, in a word, the revolution itself,
which opened up a channel for general improvement,
are so many circumstances that
conspire together to render the already
widely extended connexion of Great Britain
with Peru, every day more cordial in
the minds of the natives of this important
republic; and when the country becomes
more settled under the direction of a wise
government, such as its friends are now in
expectation of enjoying under the protection
of his excellency General Santa Cruz, it is to
be hoped that, this international friendship
may be rendered still more intimate, and
mutually beneficial, than it is at present.</p>

<p>Should the projected plan of the Pacific
Steam Navigation Company<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> be happily
carried into execution, from which a high
moral influence may be reasonably expected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and our commercial dealings with Peru be
further extended, then will the religious
wants of British residents become proportionably
more deserving of public attention.
The individual labour and exertions of these
enterprising Britons, in a distant part of the
globe, contribute to encourage manufactures
and industry in their native land; and,
though separated from their kindred and
country by a wide-spreading ocean, they
are rarely so happy as when they think
of that home to which it is their daily
wish to return, and never cease to feel that
once their hearts and warmest sympathies
were English. But, unhappily, to keep the
heart pure in the midst of the greatest national
relaxation of morals,—the strongest
allurements to vice,—with few incitements
to virtue, and no effective encouragement
to religion,—is an achievement far too
great for the average of mankind.</p>

<p>When young men destined for foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
countries leave home at an early age, they
are naturally more defenceless against the
insidious inroads of corruption, and more
open to new impressions flowing in upon
them from surrounding objects. Having arrived
in Spanish America, they soon forsake
the Protestant respect for the Sunday,
and yet scorn the Catholic sacrifice of the
mass; and then they insensibly enter upon
the formation of new habits grafted on the
manners and customs of the country, in
which they are as yet but strangers.</p>

<p>The elder and more considerate British
residents in Peru, we have reason to know,
feel and regret the want of an established
clergyman regularly and duly trained to
discharge the duties of his vocation, and who
should command a becoming degree of personal
influence, arising from his professional
character, learning, and piety. No individual
of the commercial body—we would
even venture to affirm, that no consular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
exertions in this spiritual department of
duty—can provide for a regular attendance
on church-service; because, on such topics,
every counting-house clerk considers himself
quite as knowing as the Consul, or any other
secular reader of church-service, to whom as
a divine they will not voluntarily accord
much deference or attention, however distinguished
that officiating individual may be
for his high character, general intelligence,
religious sincerity, and private virtue.</p>

only conferred on men of Spanish blood,
the honour of the church and civil courts
of judicature was pre-eminently fostered by
the government, and the duties of those high
vocations devolved on select individuals of
white or Spanish race. If there were exceptions
to so partial a distribution of favour,
these appear to have been made in behalf of a
few of the aborigines, or Indian people, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
blood to this day runs in the veins of some
of the first families of that country.</p>

<p>The Peruvian clergy have ever been jealous
of the dignity of their office, and consulted
purity of blood in their august order
with the same earnestness that they watched
over the orthodoxy of their faith. They appear
to have considered all mixture of African
blood as a sort of test of spiritual contamination,
and never suffered those tarnished
with it to approach the altar, except as hearers
or penitents,—never as ministers of the
sanctuary. We may reasonably suppose that
much of this partiality on the one hand, and
rigorous exclusion on the other, was originally
founded on considerations of political
jealousy and distrust; but, be that as it may,
the effects of this line of policy are still observable
notwithstanding the liberalism that
is afloat, for we do not meet with a single
curate of negro or zambo progenitors, while
in the law the majority of professors are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Spanish origin. The practice of medicine
was looked upon as the proper occupation of
those who, though possessed of some classical
attainments, were deemed unworthy a
place in the more distinguished departments
of law and theology. But this order of things
admitted of a few exceptions; for, as in the
dregs of the legal profession there were certain
tawny interlopers, so also in the higher
walks of the medical department there was
a proto-medico, and a few more physicians
of European birth or descent. The great
body of the profession, however, were raised
from among the genuine black, or other
more or less crossed Ethiopian castes, to
whom, as is affirmed by Ayanque at page
43 of his celebrated satire, titled “Lima
por dentro y fuera,” the healing art in all
its branches, and especially surgery, was almost
entirely intrusted. This arrangement,
which involved consequences of vital interest
to society, probably arose from inadequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
ideas entertained by the Spaniards respecting
the medical profession; viewing it less
as a noble science than as a superior sort of
handicraft. Certainly it did not arise from
indifference about their own lives or personal
safety; for no men are more careful
of themselves when sick, or more ready to
call in professional assistance, than the Spaniards
of South America. An idea still
prevalent is, that individuals selected from
“la gente prieta,” or the sable people,
are, on account of their more vigorous character
and constitution, the best suited for
the exercise of a laborious and active profession
in the debilitating climate of Lima,
where, in former days, young men of European
parentage not in some government employment,
or members of legal and ecclesiastical
establishments, had an insuperable aversion,
which they have not yet overcome, to
work for their bread.</p>

<p>But, leaving these matters as we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
them, we shall here give an extract from
the well-known work, titled “Mercurio
Peruano,” by which it will be seen what
was the ancient state of medicine in Peru.</p>

<p>“In the sixteenth century, the taste of our
nation leaned in favour of scholastic theology,
the philosophy of Aristotle, and the
civil law of the Romans; so that at the
period of founding the university of Saint
Mark, as well as for some time after, there
were established for teaching each of the
above branches of learning a competent
number of well-endowed professorships; and,
moreover, colleges were erected not only
in Lima, but in all the principal cities within
the viceroyalty of Peru, for teaching the
same.</p>

<p>“For medicine two chairs were appointed
or intended,—one (de prima) on the
theory of medicine, and the other (de
visperas) on pathology; but, no salaries
being fixed, these fell to the ground. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
is not therefore to be wondered at, that
when, in the year 1637, they deliberated
upon restoring the medical professorships,
it was stated by Dr. Huerta, that in
arts, laws, and theology, there had flourished
a large number of doctors, enumerating
about one hundred in Lima that very
year, (seventy years from the foundation of
the university,) but that in this lapse of time
only three or four physicians were known
among them, who, having studied in other
parts, had incorporated themselves with the
university.”</p>

<p>It was at the same time urged by Dr.
Huerta (who was professor of the Quichua
language) that the appointment of medical
professors was quite useless, “as it was notorious
that the Indians performed better
cures than the physicians, recovering those
whom the doctors had given up for lost;
and, moreover, that many who were for some
time in hospitals had from their own experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
found out how to cure very successfully,
without being professed doctors,
like Martin Sanches and Juan Ximenes.”</p>

<p>Let no one suppose, from the date of the
fact here stated, that the age of empiricism
is passed away; for now, in the nineteenth
century, we have hospital-dressers who take
upon themselves the character of instructed
practitioners, and are employed as such;
while the famous curandera, or doctress, La
Señora Dorotea, wants not among the opulent
and best-informed persons of Lima warm
defenders of her skill and superiority over the
doctors of the university.</p>

<p>Before an anatomical amphitheatre was
opened in Lima in the year 1792, the study
of the healing art continued to be much
neglected, as we are informed by the founder
of this school, who, after some statements
on this important subject,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> observes, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the public instruction of medicine being
wanting in the royal seminary, and having
no colleges that might supply this deficiency,
it followed as a consequence that in the
medical profession those improvements had
not been made that the importance of the art
demanded,—a great detriment to the public
health. Some years after the anatomical
amphitheatre, or practical school of anatomy,
was formed, its founder was raised to the
head of the medical profession in Peru; and,
desirous to advance medical science among
his countrymen, he had further prevailed
with the viceregal government to establish
a college of medicine and surgery in Lima
as an independent medical seminary, dedicated
to San Fernando, in honour of their
august sovereign Ferdinand VII. of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
This college, as we are informed by one of
its earliest inmates, was established in the
year 1809, and in it different professorships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
were properly assigned. Here there was a
professor of chemistry, but, for want of
suitable apparatus, he had not yet opened
an experimental course; a professor of
botany, who really gave some practical
lessons when walking out with his pupils in
the neighbouring “<i>potreros</i>” or grazing parks.
There were also professors of the practice of
medicine and surgery, &amp;c. all on a goodly
plan, after the manner of European colleges.
But, while these improvements were going
on, the revolution came, to do evil that good
might come; and then all the fair hopes from
the college of San Fernando were nipped in
the bud.</p>

<p>This seminary, which, at present, metaphorically
represents the tree of knowledge,
stripped of its green leaves and fair promise,
under the shade of the wide-spreading tree
of liberty, on which it is to be hoped that
science ere long may be grafted, is, in its now
blighted condition, under the nominal rectorship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of Doctor Don Caietano Heredia, one
of the earliest and most illustrious of the
disciples educated in this school,—a gentleman
who, to his infinite praise, caught
no small portion of that love of knowledge,
and desire to disseminate it, which so eminently
distinguished the eloquent founder,
Don Hipolito Unanue.</p>

<p>We may briefly remark that, at the period
when the revolution broke out in Lima,
there were in the medical profession some
men of excellent classical knowledge, well
versed in medical literature; and the valuable
libraries which some of them have
left behind them would, if only spared by
the most destructive moth of that country,
long stand as monuments of their professional
scholarship. Among the junior physicians
of the capital there is less ancient
learning, but a better acquaintance with
modern authors, especially French works,
which are imported very freely; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
revolution, which so lately subverted the
ancient form of government, may likewise be
said to have opened up new sources of professional
knowledge and improvement in
medical practice.</p>

<p>At present, however, young men hardly
acquire the rudiments of medical knowledge
when they are hurried away to the army;
and having never enjoyed the advantages
of an early systematic education, and being
thus hurried into practice, it is to be feared
that many of them will be satisfied with the
perusal of a few manuals or formularies, and
never attain enlarged views of their profession.
But the military surgeon has ample
opportunities of using the knife; and surgery
is now very much improved in Peru, where,
till lately, the first principles of this branch
of the profession were ill understood. The
pharmacy of Lima consisted chiefly of herbs
and simples, till English and French apothecaries’
stores were opened, and furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the public with the best remedies, which
were soon approved, and recommended by
those native physicians who adopted a more
active practice than their predecessors. In
the present day nearly all the native physicians
of any note order their prescriptions
from the French apothecaries.</p>

<p>This leads us to remark, that in the well-known
Memoirs of General Miller there is a
lively account of the wandering practisers of
physic of the aboriginal tribe of Callavayas
or Yungeños, who, laden with barks, balsams,
and herbs, are said to migrate periodically
from the vicinity of La Paz, and “traverse
the mountains of Peru, Quito, and Chile, and
the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, exercising
their vocation wherever their assistance is
required, to the distance of five or six hundred
leagues.” Some medicinal herbs collected
on the mountains and in the valleys
are always in requisition, and constitute the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
chief ingredients of the domestic medicine of
those who inhabit the villages of the interior
of Peru; but as French and English assortments
of medicine have become so common of
late, the Callavayas have ceased to visit such
parts of that country as we are acquainted
with. But there are still a set of quacks, generally
men of swarthy and mixed race, in
every town and village of general traffic or
importance, who subsist on the credulity of
mankind, and are appropriately distinguished
by the name of Mata-sanos, or killers of
the healthy.</p>

<p>No active measures have yet been adopted
to suppress the flagrant abuses of the Mata-sanos,
who infest the interior villages of Peru;
where, we regret to say, even the regular
practitioner is a kind of public extortioner,
who, persuaded that the price of his services
is never to be paid after pain and the sense
of danger are removed from the sick, is accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to make his bargain, and withhold
his remedy till he secures beforehand his fee:
and the bargain is usually screwed up to the
utmost when the patient is known to be rich,
and believes his own life in danger. In consideration
of the medical destitution of the
interior of the republic, and the crying evil
thus entailed on the community, it was suggested
to the legitimate government in the
year 1835, that, from every prefectorate of
the republic, a certain number of disciples
should be sent to be educated at the common
expense, in the medical college at
Lima; and that after these young men
had completed their studies, and were found
duly qualified to exercise the medical profession,
they should be made to return as
practitioners to their respective provinces.
This proposal would probably have been carried
into effect, had the country been left to
enjoy public tranquillity; and it is obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
how easily, under such an arrangement, villages
and districts of several thousand inhabitants
could, by contributing an average
annual sum of only a few reals from each
individual, procure for themselves a salaried
medical adviser, from the midst of their own
Indian or mixed population, in every way
the most fitted to pass his time usefully and
agreeably among his native hills. But, as
things are at present, it is almost impossible,
even at great expense to individuals, to procure
proper medical attendance in the time
of need; for the variable climate and temperature
of the interior changing from hill
to dingle, and frequently from league to
league, is peculiarly unfavourable and disagreeable
to the constitution and habits of
the medical gentlemen of the coast, (among
whom there are some highly respectable and
able men,) who are commonly of various
gradations of caste, from the black through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
all the tints between this colour and white
or European; so that we need not be surprised
at the reluctance of these individuals
to undertake the practice, or expose themselves
to the privations of the frigid regions
of the interior. But the people of the Sierra,
or upland of Peru, being unprovided with
medical teachers of their own, can only
rely on the capital and coast (where there
is no scarcity of doctors, both native and
foreign,) for the supply of such regularly
educated physicians or surgeons as are here
and there found in the interior; and even
these are not always stationary in one town
or province, but often ambulate backwards
and forwards as their interest or inclination
happen to dictate. But, whether settled
permanently in one locality or not, it usually
happens that when the Sierra doctor is called
upon to visit a patient, he rises from the
card or diceing table; and the sort of prescription
given for the cure of the sick will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
naturally depend on the state of mind in which
the gambler happens to be at the time.</p>

<p>Having said so much on the state of the
medical schools and practice of medicine, it
may be expected that we should advert to
the interesting subject of schools and education
in general.</p>

<p>Small schools for reading, on the Lancasterian
plan, are very common in the capital,
and not unknown in the provincial and inland
towns; and all—we think all—the
white children are taught to read and write.
The Bible too, as translated by Scio, is openly
sold by book-dealers, and it is read by individuals
in the Spanish language; but no
<i>Mr. Wood</i><a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is found among them, to carry
forward the instruction of the pupils on the
basis of the sacred writings.</p>

<p>Close to the public library at St. Pedro’s
church, which contains a large and valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
collection of books, there is a Latin
academy, which was intended to be a great
national school after the declaration of Peruvian
independence; but it is not, we believe,
now in a flourishing state: and the colleges
of San Carlos and San Toribio have dwindled
away under the baneful influence of a
succession of revolutions, and governments
misnamed patriotic, which are as hostile to
science, though on a different principle, as
was the dark reign of the inquisition under
the sway of old Spain.</p>

<p>Early in the nineteenth, as we have already
shown to have been the case in the sixteenth
century, the taste of the natives leaned
to scholastic theology, the philosophy of
Aristotle, and the civil law of the Romans.</p>

<p>Heineccius still preserves his authority
within the cloisters of the Lima colleges,
which are too often deserted for want of
funds for their support,—one of the many
evils consequent on frequent political commotions!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been long a subject of remark and
regret, that, in these principal seminaries of
learning, scarcely any of the scholars attended
to their studies, except those who were
sent from remote provinces, and who were
not yet wedded to the idle and luxurious
habits of the Limenian youth. Indeed, the
expression “buen colegial” is proverbial in
all Peru as peculiarly characteristic of young
gentlemen devoted to gallantry, or who are
observed to care more for their loves than
their lessons.</p>

<p>A new school for law and philosophy was
commenced in Lima, a few years ago, by
Don Jose Joaquin de Mora, who for some
time delivered lectures, and also published
a text-book on the Scotch philosophy, which
he taught with credit.</p>

<p>Mr. Mora, himself a native of Spain, has
thus opened, in Peru and Bolivia, new
sources of investigation in the departments
of metaphysical and ethical science. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a civilian more especially, this indefatigable
individual has acquired transcendent
celebrity in those countries. Still, however,
the blessing of well-directed instruction
is confined to a very few; and
the lower classes of dark race, as well
as the Indian orders of the Peruvian
people, have seldom any education except
that which is necessarily acquired
in the ordinary intercourse between man
and man, without the medium of letters,
and in the usual discharge of the common
duties of life; for the exercise of
which it should be the main object of education
to prepare the individual, so as to
fit him to act his part in society with dignity
and usefulness, becoming a being of
immortal nature.</p>

<p>But we need hardly remark, that in Lima
the ornamental takes precedence of the useful;
because there the chief aim of education
is to train the young to please in company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
by such accomplishments as music,
dancing, and play, with only a very superficial
acquaintance with more solid attainments.
From what has been already stated
in the course of the preceding pages, it may
be inferred that female education, especially,
is very much of the kind now alluded to;
though among the fair sex there is a great
abundance of excellent talent, which, if properly
directed, could not fail to be productive
of the best social results.</p>

<p>But it is not our purpose to speculate
on plans of public instruction, or to point out
what may be called the philosophy of education;
into the secret of which, we think,
an English friend, the father of four well-brought-up
boys, has pretty well penetrated,
when he enjoins, as a <i>sine quâ non</i> of good
tuition, absolute obedience, under good example,
in early life. How very little philosophy
has to do with the present style
of training youth in Peru, and Lima in particular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
we think the general moral details
of this book are well calculated to show;
for early indulgence takes the place of obedience,
and the influence of example is not
always the best: yet upon the whole, when
free from civil discord, they are pleased with
themselves,</p>

<p>The space enclosed between the gigantic
ridges of the eastern and western Cordillera,
or great and frigid mountain-chains of the
Andes, is occupied by numerous table-lands
yielding short fine grass, and extensive
hilly pasture-ground, very like in general
outline to the Highlands of Scotland,
though destitute of heath: and over this
very uneven surface are interspersed lagoons
and rivers, and deep, warm, agricultural valleys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in the bottom of which grow the
richest fruits and produce of the coast;
while the summits of the hills, that rise
from and enclose these fertile dales, are
exposed to the violence of the tempest in
the elevated regions of cold and barrenness.</p>

<p>From one of these glens, where we once
resided for some time, we left a house at
the door of which the lemon-tree was in
perpetual fruit and blossom, and, in two or
three hours thereafter, arrived at the rugged
crags and peaks of the eastern Cordillera.</p>

<p>The lines of road from the western coast
to the central Andes of Peru wind along
narrow glens, sometimes contracting into
mere ravines, edged by lofty hills or prodigious
rocks that close in abruptly. The
traveller thus journeys for days, leaving one
hill behind, and meeting another rising
before; but never arrives at that ideal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
spot, whence he may command a view from
sea to sea,</p>

<p>The highest mountains in Britain, such
as Ben-Nevis or Cruachan,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> must appear
very diminutive, when compared to the
Andes, whose very vastness and extent preclude
from the inland regions any view of
the sun dipping under the waves of the Pacific,
and whose magnitude limits the quickest
sight to the groups of mountains, with
their included dales, that go to form one
stupendous pile of varied shape, production,
and climate.</p>

<p>Many of the mountain roads, as they
leave the bottom of the glens, and ascend,
in more or less of a caracole, along the face
of formidable steeps, seem to bear date of
origin from the Quichua era, when the
llama was the only beast of burden in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
country. These animals, like their Indian
owners, delight most in the cool of the
hills; but, when laden and on the road,
their slow and stately gait must not be
hurried or interfered with, nor their burden
increased beyond their liking, which seldom
exceeds 70 or 80 lbs. weight on a long journey:
the Indian understands their way, and
rules them by gentleness. As the llamas
are not for forced marches, and only make
short stages of three or four leagues daily,
the paths that lead through pasture-grounds
are the best suited for them, and may have
been considered by the ancient inhabitants
of the land as a sufficient reason for striking
off from a barren though less elevated or
precipitous path, and climbing to eminences
that yield an agreeable temperature and
some herbage to the indigenous companions
of their toil.</p>

<p>When a person has occasion to traverse
these narrow and fatiguing roads, it is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
for him to keep a good look-out,
lest he should clash with some rider or cargo-beast
coming in the opposite direction; for
there are places where it would be utterly
impossible to pass two a-breast; and there
would be no small danger, on meeting an
impatient animal or careless horseman, that
either party would be hurled over the brink,
and consigned to the condors and eaglets
that nestle on the cliffs and in the dark
chasms of the crags.</p>

<p>Such dangerous passes are at some places
so contracted that the stirrup of the muleteer
is seen to overhang the foaming stream, or
project beyond the verge of the boldest precipice;
and every now and then they are
made more formidable by abrupt angles and
insecure breast-work without parapets, hastily
constructed when the rush of a sudden torrent
from the hollow of a hill, or large stones
rolling from the heights, have cleft the way
so as to render it for a time impassable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>There are also many cuestas or rapid
steeps, with here and there flights of steps,
roughly cut in the hard rock. By the way-side,
in tedious cuestas of several leagues in
extent, recesses are, in numerous instances,
worked out on the higher side of the road,
which serve for the passengers to draw up
while those from an opposite direction are
allowed to pass on, or where muleteers stop
their cattle to adjust their cargoes and tighten
their lazos. But when a rock or shoulder of
a cliff juts out from the road towards the
lower or precipice side, leaving more or less
room for a resting-place, then the little flat
space is coarsely walled in with large fragments
of rock and such smaller stones as
may be at hand, giving the idea of a rude
but commanding fortress.</p>

<p>The famous Cuesta of San Mateo, on the
Tarma road from Lima, we passed in the
year 1834, and could not but wonder how,
without any very serious accident, an army of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
cavalry, destined to celebrate the “fraternal
embrace of Maquenguaio,”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> had been able to
pass the same route a few months before,
when the path and staircases were yet wet
and slippery from occasional showers; and
when the lower or proper post-road was unfortunately
impassable, from the destruction
of one of the ordinary rustic bridges on the
river or torrent, that runs at the bottom of
the rock-locked ravine through which the
regular mule-way has been opened, and by
which the waters rush foaming and raging
in time of heavy inland rains. This stream,
like all such impetuous torrents, during the
force of the rainy season on the high mountains
and table-lands, carries in its course a
vast number of rolling stones, the thundering
noise of which rises far above the roar of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
white waters as these are thrown back, and
resisted incessantly, by large blocks of rocky
fragments that half-choke the narrow channel,
which at this remarkable place is bordered by
immense rocks looking as if they had been
separated by violence, or rent to give descent
to the concentrated and united body
of rivulets that come from many a snowy
peak, mountain lake, and marsh.</p>

<p>The hill along which runs the Cuesta
road, rising on the face of the steep that
overhangs this part of the stream, is of itself
a grand object; but that which is seen opposite
to it has the greatest elevation of any
single mountain in these narrow glens: and
nothing of the kind can be more strikingly
magnificent than to behold it, girdled in
verdure and capped in snow, from the summit
of the Cuesta, where the traveller, tired
with climbing, is invited to draw breath,
and look around him from the cross planted
here, as in almost every similar situation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
by the pious among the natives, who love
to decorate this emblem of their faith with
wreaths of fresh and fragrant flowers. But
from the better route, which winds by the
river underneath, nothing of this sort is to be
seen; for here the hills on each side shelve in
towards their rugged foundations, until they
come so close as completely to overshadow
the stream. Here, too, the rider may strain
his neck in looking overhead; but his eye only
meets, besides a strip of the sky, pendulous
succulents and tangling plants on the face
of the incumbent ledge, with now and then
a flower-enamoured “pica-flor,” (humming-bird,)
as he fans, with a gracefully tremulous
wing, the expanding blossoms that yield him
delicate food and pastime.</p>

<p>These wilds of San Mateo reminded us
forcibly of the miniature wilds of Glencoe, remarkable
in Scottish history; and we thought,
as we passed them, of the bard of Cona
(Ossian), who, in honour of the orb which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Peruvians once adored, sung with sublimity
and touching pathos,</p>

<p>“O thou that rollest above, round as the
shield of my fathers, whence are thy beams,
O Sun! thy everlasting light? Thou comest
forth in thy awful beauty; the stars hide
themselves in the sky; the moon, cold and
pale, sinks in the western wave; but thou
thyself movest alone. Who can be a companion
of thy course?”</p>

<p>The Indian’s eyrie on the summit of some
steep and lofty mountain, (seldom visited
by a white man, save the curate,) may be
easily passed many times unnoticed by a
stranger, who has occasion to go over the
usual routes in any of the principal ravines
and valleys of the Sierra, and who may never
be led to suspect its existence till he one
day meets a swift-footed Indian, closely followed
by a person on a well-accoutred and
elegant mule, whose gear is all laden with
silver ornaments; and the rider, who sits at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
his ease in a saddle of the country with a
rich pellon, wears a large-brimmed hat, with
a black silk cap emerging to view at the ears
and temples. He has on at least a couple of
ponchos (mantles) well-decorated and fringed;
his black or brown stockings are of warm
Vicuña wool; and the heel of a small shoe,
half-concealed in a clumsy and costly, though
wooden stirrup, is armed with a prodigiously
disproportioned silver spur, with a large tinkling
roller, used to keep his noble animal in
mind that she is but the harbinger of death,
and carries on her back the keeper of the
sinner’s conscience.</p>

<p>This minister of peace to the miserable,
hurries to save the soul of a dying Christian,
whose abode, like the falcon’s, overlooks the
ordinary path of wayfaring men; and which,
when descried, seems, to the sight of an observer
underneath, to be indeed the loftiest
earthly point between the ground he himself
stands upon and that heaven for which, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
believed, the anxious and fluttering spirit of
the gasping Indian, only waits the curate’s
absolution and blessing to wing its immortal
flight. It occurs to us here to remark, that
in the remote curacies of the hills no friars
are to be seen, as on the coast or more genial
climates; an important part of whose duty
it is, wherever they locate themselves, to aid
the Christian to die well, and to watch by
his pillow, and exhort and comfort him,
while the crucifix and taper are ever before
his eyes, and the breath of life about to leave
his animal frame. But, destitute of these
helps, the curate or curate-substitute, whose
calling renders him the most influential person
and only spiritual comforter in an Indian
village, makes, in the appearance we have
offered to describe, his rapid way over hill
and cliff, broken ravine and dangerous path,
on a chosen traveller, whose movements are
so gentle that she never wearies the rider.
This mule seems not to make any trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
exertion, while she leaves all ordinary beasts
of her kind behind her on a day’s journey,
and ascends a cuesta of three or four leagues
without stopping once to draw breath, and
again descends the same without missing
a foot or slackening the “paso llano,”
the best of all travelling paces; while, to
her no small recommendation, where horse-shoers
are not to be found, whether on
hard ground or soft, in summer or in winter,
she needs not a shoe on her massy and well-rounded
hoof. The Sierra curates of a dreary
pastoral district, or secluded Indian residence
in the wheat-land temperatures, are men,
at the age of forty, commonly much worn out
in constitution. One of these gentlemen, to
whom his home is irksome, is seen to read
for weeks together on a stretch, merely to
kill time; or he longs for the more refined
“tertulia,” to which at one period he was no
stranger; or he starts off, swayed by some
sudden impulse, to the nearest town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
white inhabitants, where he enjoys a finer
climate and more gratifying company. He
not unfrequently resorts to a mineral “pueblo”
(village), under pretext perhaps of selling
his “primicia” or first-fruits in grain, &amp;c.
which, to be sure, he does to some purpose;
for ten to one he will gamble with the
extravagant miners, day and night, till the
product of the primicia is all swallowed up;
and the poor residentiary returns to his
cheerless manse involved in a debt which he
cannot pay for the next six months, even
should his curacy be worth four or five
thousand dollars a year, though it oftener
happens that the income is much less. In
his mountain curacy, wherein he endures sad
periods of ennui and long and frequent fasts,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
that debilitate and break down the best constitution,
(for before he can reach a distant
church, and say mass, the day is often far advanced,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the curate complains of feeling himself
an exile; and is easily led to seek refuge
from his self-weariness in various indulgences
that far overstep the barriers of self-denial,
and plunge him into the outskirts of that
moral darkness which he is sent to enlighten.</p>

<p>Here, if anywhere on earth, the drawbacks
of involuntary celibacy are felt by the
priest. For such canonical privations he usually
searches compensation in the less amiable
society of a favourite “sobrina,” or reputed
niece, whose kindness hinges on a precarious
friendship, and whose artful complacency</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">“hardens a’ within,</div>
<div class="verse">And petrifies the feeling!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But while we regret the evils thus entailed
on the curate by the established usage
and Romish policy<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of the sacred orders,
we do with pleasure and grateful remembrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
assure our readers that, from the individual
curates spread over the hill-land of
this thinly inhabited country, the foreigner
and traveller is always sure to meet with the
greatest kindness and hospitality. Further
to illustrate the moral and physical aspect of
the Sierra, we would mention that once, when
on a journey in the interior, we had the good
fortune to fall in with a clerical gentleman,
whose vigour of mind was not to be overcome
by the dreariness of his residence at Cauri, a
puna village of cold and shivering aspect.
This active and spirited person came up to
us as we crossed the celebrated road-way of
the Incas, on the heights of Huamalies, and
we descended together towards the village
of Jesus, only a few leagues distant; but
before we could reach this place his fine
mule began to trip, then tottered, and soon
failed entirely in her hind-legs, as if struck
by palsy. She was unsaddled, she immediately
stretched herself on the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
swelled out rapidly, struggled and groaned,
and in less than half an hour died.</p>

<p>The priest, who on this occasion showed
himself to be not at all unacquainted with
practical farriery, felt like one who had lost
a tried and valued companion. He soon,
however, reconciled himself to a misfortune
beyond his power to remedy; and ordering
his Indian page to walk down hill, (after
he had secured the saddle and trappings
of the favourite animal here left to the
hungry condors, on the back of the cargo-mule,
or bed-mule, driven before us,) the
jovial priest mounted the Indian’s little rough
poney, and we all arrived safely at our destination
early in the evening. The cattle—every
hoof—were in distant pastures, and
the priest could not be provided with another
mule before next morning. We therefore
passed the evening agreeably under the
same roof, where a pretty-looking white
mouse was caged, and kept as a precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
remedy and charm against all diseases; and
some such wizard power as this timid creature
was supposed to possess, these poor
mountaineers stood much in need of, as no
surgeon or physician ever resides among
them. At the village of Jesus we arrived
in the dry season, when its nearest plains
wore a stunted and withered aspect, and
when there was no crop in the ground—not
their ordinary potato crop, which indeed
is their only one; and which in some
years succeeds, while in other years it fails on
account of the frost. But, during the rainy
season, when frost is unknown in the deep
ravines and lofty arable heights and acclivities
of the inland country,—where the highest-perched
houses are seen, on arriving at
them, to have still higher back-grounds,—the
Indians, each of whom cultivates his own
patch of ground, drive all their cattle to
the remotest pastures of their extensive common;
because they cannot consent to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
them feeding near their doors, and crops,
which have no proper enclosures.</p>

<p>The Indians and curates have, for the
most part, very opposite interests to support
in worldly matters; and they are often
seen contending with one another in hard
bargains when arranging the business of
first-fruits, (for tithes are collected by the
state,) marriages, burials, and religious festivals,
which latter are closely interwoven
with the entire social system of the country.
These contentions tend to lower the respectability
and sacredness of the proper priestly
character; and there are not wanting examples
of the Indian carrying his ill-will
so far as to desire to be revenged of his
ghostly father in a sly way.</p>

<p>On one celebrated occasion the Indians
of Huamantanga, situated on the western
slope of the Andes, and not far inland from
the capital, advised their curate that in a
hamlet on a distant hill-top a man was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
dying; so that, if the curate did not use
much haste to assist him, he would necessarily
die without confession. The curate
replied, “But how am I to reach him?—There
is no mule at hand; they are all in
the remote common.” An Indian promptly
answered, “I will fetch one.” But the
curate knew that at that time, on account
of the numerous crops, no mule was or
could be near. He therefore became suspicious
respecting the good faith of those
about him, for he was old, and had experience
of the perverse and cunning disposition
of Indians; but, when the man came to him
with a very good-looking mule, he suppressed
his sentiments, and asked if the animal
was accustomed to be ridden by a curate.
“Sabe la mula de cura?” The Indian replied,
“La mula es buena,”—the mule is a
good one. “Yes,” says the curate; “but
let us see if she have acquaintance with a
curate.” He now cast off his clerical habit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and, having dressed the Indian as a curate,
he made the wily rogue mount the beast;
when she reared, kicked, and flung violently,
until she dashed him to the ground. To
the crafty villager, now caught in his own
snare, the churchman good-naturedly observed,
“You <i>feel</i>, my man, that the mule,
though a good one, yet knows nothing of a
curate; and, as there is no other alternative,
your friend must survive his present illness,
or go down to the grave without confession.”
But to the grave he went not on this occasion,
for the whole was intended as a trick
by which the curate might be deceived to
his personal hurt or destruction; but, as
far as we could judge, our jolly acquaintance
at Jesus was quite a favoured individual,
who had nothing to fear from the
mule next morning brought for his service.</p>

<p>This gentleman had a great many occupations
besides the ordinary professional
duties of saying mass, hearing confessions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and absolving sins. He supplied his people
with whisky, of which he was the only
distiller, and they the principal consumers.
He considered it a proud discovery, (of
which few of his neighbours were in the
secret,) that ardent spirits could be made
from barley, reared on the hills at comparatively
little expense for the grain-grower;
while the usual sugar-cane spirit, or “agua
ardiente,” extracted by the help of the inferior
copper, or the still worse earthen stills
of the interior, had no superiority over it. On
the other hand, the “pisco,” or finer flavoured
<i>Italia</i>, both of which are procured from the
fermented juice of the grape, could only be
got, and at great expense of land-carriage,
from the coast. He therefore hoped to supersede
by his whisky the use of the cane-spirit
or pale rum, called “agua ardiente,”
or “agua ardiente de caña,” because it was
sometimes very expensive, and frequently
bad; not from any pernicious quality in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the saccharine juice, as some natives have
imagined, but on account of the defective
mode of distillation by poor people, who
buy up from the sugar-growers molasses,
and a coarse brown sugar, made into little
cakes, called “chancaca,” for the purpose of
being converted into “agua ardiente,” for
which there is always great demand in the
colder and mineral districts.</p>

<p>Our speculative priest had a farm in the
temperate neighbourhood of a place and curacy
called Caina, which lay convenient to
his own spiritual flock. Here he cultivated
abundance of grain, and possessed extensive
pasture grounds. He purchased the “primicia”
(first-fruits) of his brethren in Conchucos,
and other mountain ranges and elevated
districts, wherein church-rates are paid in cattle,
as the staple commodity of lands chiefly
fitted for pasturage. These cattle he placed
on grass, when young and cheap; and
when they became in high condition, drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
them carefully along the least frequented
paths on the verdant heights, to the clover
or alfalfa fields in the headland vales of
the coast, where they were in demand by
the grazier and butcher. He also contracted
for so many thousand arobes of
sugar yearly, with the planters in Huailas;
and by the aid of his Cauri friends and
customers, had his sugar conducted to Cerro
Pasco at a lower rate of land-carriage than
any one else in this line of trade; and, dealing
on a large scale, he believed that he could
easily undersell the smaller trader.</p>

<p>The Cauri muleteers employed by the
priest are staunch hearty fellows who swig
off a bottle of whisky, or “agua ardiente,”
as if it were less than a mouthful; for they
call a bottle a “gota,” or a drop, which
shows they hold it as too small a dose for
their well-seasoned stomachs.</p>

<p>Our priest also engaged to supply mines,
in the adjacent country, with salt for benefiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
or preparing metals, which the Caurimen,
with their little broad-backed and
hardy nags, are used to convey from Huacho
on the coasts of the Pacific, by the vale
of Sayan, across the Cordillera. He was
withal a watch-maker to the neighbouring
villages within many leagues of his residence,
and knew, if we forget not, how to put the
church organ to rights when out of repair.</p>

<p>His people were apparently fond of so
stirring and general a speculator; and as
they can only grow for themselves, and that
in the most sheltered corners, very bad potatoes,
with frequent failures in the harvest,
(though their common yields good pasture,)
their pastor supplied them with maize, (as
the miner in isolated localities supplies, at
large profits, maize and clothing, &amp;c. to his
workmen,) on which, with potatoes, cheese,
eggs, and guinea-pigs, they principally support
themselves. Butter they rarely know
how to churn; and, as the milk is chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
used for making cheese, it is not often drunk
as an article of nutriment, save by those who
live in small round booths, that are ever
and anon guarded by a host of noisy curs,
with hair as shaggy and matted as that
which covers the heads of the urchins that
feed them. These pastoral huts are scattered
over the distant plains and ranges of
the mountains throughout the “estancias,”
or tracts of hilly pasture-land allotted for
rearing and feeding cattle and sheep. At
such estancias and huts, the traveller in the
interior of Peru has frequently to rest for the
night.</p>

<p>The poor Indian owner of a few horned
cattle, will rather languish with hunger
than slaughter one head of his fold for his
private consumption; but he who owns a
small flock of sheep can more conveniently
sustain himself on meat and “caldo,”—mutton
tea, (for vegetables are commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
wanting to make that kind of broth which
is to be found at the grain-grower’s,) especially
when any traveller passes that way,
who buys one of his small sheep—much
smaller on the hills than in the warm valleys—for
use on the road, and employs the
Indian himself to butcher it. These inhabitants
of the snowy range, or lofty dales
of the Andes, we frequently met,—and they
are easily known by their warm clothing,
capacious chests, and ruddy complexions,—descending
from the frigid regions to the
temperate and grain valleys, to barter for
the vegetable productions of the agriculturist
fresh mutton, which, already skinned
and free from offal, they carry on donkeys
(animals which in the hands of the Indian
escape the cruel stripes and goads inflicted
on them by the merciless negro or zambo);
and this meat, like beef, being previously
dried in the sun, is laid up for use by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
dweller of the warm and narrow glen overhung
by scorched and rocky acclivities, who
places it before the traveller, under the usual
name of “charque,” of which we have often
eaten with a good appetite.</p>

<p>But to return to our priest: it is to be
hoped that, in contributing as much as he
did to supply the temporal wants of the
hardy attendants at his confessional, he did
not irretrievably overlook their Christian and
spiritual necessities. From the combined results
of his various undertakings, he cherished
a glowing expectation of realizing a
fortune; but, as we never heard of his
success, we think it allowable to suppose
that, like other speculators, he must have
experienced some severe reverse or serious
disappointment, as is quite usual in
that country.</p>

<p>When morning arrived, we had our good
<i>chupe</i>,—a common and standard dish of
the Sierra, consisting of potatoes sliced down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and boiled in water or milk, with an addition
of eggs, cheese, and, when very nice,
butter; but, on many occasions, especially
in Huamalies, the traveller only gets <i>yaco</i>-chupe,
or water chupe, consisting merely of
potatoes sliced and boiled in water, with the
addition of a little salt, and a leaflet of wild
mint, if at hand, as a useful antidote against
flatulency and uneasiness at stomach.</p>

<p>After we had finished breakfast, and found
our cattle in readiness, we were sorry to part
with our agreeable acquaintance, whose presence
and influence furnished us with better
fare and accommodation than we usually experienced
on our Sierra journeys. This remarkable
person was a native of Quito; and
whatever may be thought of his enterprise
and commercial spirit, like all Quiteños
we were acquainted with in Peru, he was
distinguished for his native talent and ingenuity.</p>

<p>Our way now lay among the ruins of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
buildings and small towns, with here
and there, along the higher ridges, some detached
and more stately-looking architectural
remains. These relics of the olden times
offer far finer samples of masonry than the
dry stone and thatched houses of any modern
Indian village. The old line of communication
between Quito and Cuzco, where we met our
Quitenian friend on the preceding day, is a
wonderful monument of rude art and industry.
This imperial road of the Incas is still perfect
in many parts, where the stones appear
well fitted and laid in good order, the pavement
rising above the level of the plain, and
being of a spacious breadth.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>We entered one of the houses in “Pueblo
Viejo,” or ruins of an old town so called, by
the way-side, not far from the celebrated
ruins of the ancient city Leon de Huanuco,
deemed by the natives as only second to
Cuzco—the capital of the empire of the
Incas—in the wonders of its masonry.
We found the walls of this house, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
where defaced by the mischievous hands of
man, quite entire, and one angle of the
building had yet retained the roof. The
windows were small, but the outer door
of good size. The walls were as perpendicular
as plumb and line in our days
could make them, though two stories high.
These walls were built with small stones,
mostly flags; and between them a thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
layer of mud or clay cement. There were,
within, stone partitions rising to the level
of the outward walls, making the compartments
of the house so confined that the
roof was easily laid on by long and broad
flags projecting from the sides, on which
they were steadied by a top-weight, and,
meeting at the centre, were so adjusted as
to render the closing of the roof perfect.
The same appeared to have been the manner
in which the floor of the second story
had been laid. At the roof, the flags
were observed to shoot forwards to some
extent outside the wall, doubtless with a
view to preserve a perfect equilibrium,—as
we have frequently seen on the smaller
houses of ancient Indian architecture, which
abound near the village of Ambo on the
heights of Andaguaylla. The lofty and weather-worn
peaks of this estate go to form the
ridge of the eastern Cordillera, where the
path from these summits descends towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the pueblo of Yuramarca on the verge of
the Montaña, known in regal times as the
asylum of the fugitive criminal.</p>

<p>This hacienda, partaking of the climate of
the torrid and frigid zones, and consisting of
successive table-lands and steep hills, has
frigid summits and ever-blooming dales.
Its lakes of <i>Rumichaca</i>, so named because
their waters escape under a natural bridge
of rock; its Indian moats and fortifications
on the heights of Rucrun, and the ruins of
which we have just made mention; its woods
of alder and perejil; its bamboo thickets,
numerous dingles, and silvery waterfalls; its
rapacious puma; its herds of deer; its narrow
pathways and slippery pastures, from
whence the grazing ox so often rolls to
the fathomless ravine,—are still present
to our mind in one group, with the
lovely conjunction of the cultivated vales of
Huacar and Huaylas, and the watery cross
formed by the confluence of their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
streams, where the river of Huanuco
commences its gently winding course. All
these crowd into our retrospect, as they are
viewed by the imagination in one splendid
landscape from the commanding eminences
of this fine estate, in contrast with all the
boundless mountain-scenery stretching to the
west.</p>

<p>Of the houses of the Gentiles, as the natives
usually call the antiquated buildings
we would wish to describe, (and in the
hiding-nooks of which treasure is sometimes
found,) the roof is rounded or finished
off by stones and clay or earth, so as
to throw over the heavy rains that at certain
seasons of the year fall in these places.
This species of building, as it needed no
timber, was naturally recommended in frigid
woodless plains and almost inaccessible hill-tops,
such as abound in the Sierra or mountain-land
of Peru; but in situations like Andaguaylla,
where wood surrounds the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Indian houses, they could only adhere to this
form of building, on account of their higher
perfection in masonry than carpentry, which
required the use of tools and art that they
evidently did not possess.</p>

<p>In the temperate climate of Tarma, situated
in the centre of the Andes in an east-north-east
direction from Lima, where the
houses are generally tiled, and the better
sorts of them neatly floored with gypsum
or stucco-plaster, the older houses are still
seen covered in with mud or red brick-clay,
underlaid and supported with strong timbers
and a coat of cane or wattling. The most
antiquated of these roofs are made with a
very slight declivity, with outlets like a ship’s
scuttle-holes at the most pending angles, so
as to give free exit to the rain when it falls
heavily. The wall of this description of
house they raise a foot or two higher than
the roof, so as to give the latter the appearance
of a little inclined plane and enclosure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and they leave triangular holes, like those of
a dove-house, in this little parapet; within
which, when the rains have passed away,
and the crops are housed, the peasants stow
peas, beans, and maize, until, by direct exposure
to a bright sun, these articles are
so dried up as to be unhusked without
trouble or loss.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Tarma is the favourite
place of resort of sickly persons from different
parts, especially Lima, and the rigorous
climate at the mineral works of Yauli,
whence the rheumatic miners, after their
own hot springs fail to cure them, flock
to the Estrada, or to the ball and tertulia
of the blooming Tarmenians. All its peaceful
inhabitants are agriculturists; and mostly
all the resident families emigrate during
harvest-time to little farms in the vicinity
of this pretty Cerrano town, which is considered
one of the most agreeable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
civilized in all the Sierra, and wherein
the better classes, even as in the provincial
towns on the coast, desire to adopt
the manners of the capital as their standard.
Near Tarma is a beautiful cascade, and
many peach and apple orchards, with lanes
lined with poplars, and perfumed with wild
mint and many sweet and fragrant flowers
in the wet season, when its hills are verdant,
its air pure, and its people joyful. The population
of the town and suburbs is estimated
at eight thousand; yet with all the
sickness to which, notwithstanding the
general salubrity of its climate, so large
a population as that of Tarma must be
subjected, this retreat of convalescents from
the coast and mineral districts is without
a medical adviser of any consideration,
except when chance throws among them one
of the faculty of Lima, himself a confirmed
invalid, or only in a state of recovery from
consumption or spitting of blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>When the people of Tarma have put the
seed into the ground, they usually occupy an
entire month in mutual visiting and festivity:
and they say of their neighbours of Jauja
(eight leagues to the south of them), whose
rejoicing is at harvest-home, that they distrust
Providence, while they themselves piously
rejoice and rest their hope in the Giver of
their harvest; hence, they infer the wheat
crops of the Jaujinos (whose granaries are in
favourable years the most plentifully stored
in all Peru) are often blighted and frosted,
while the Tarmenian barley always flourishes.
We would not quarrel with these contented
people for the moral of this anecdote to the
prejudice of their neighbours; but we wish
they would themselves make better use of
their advantages, and prepare good barley-bread,
of which they know not the use, instead
of depending upon others for their flour
and wheat,—for never did we eat such
bad bread, made of putrid flour, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
did in Tarma. Perhaps the immediately
preceding visitation of an armed force
might have been the occasion of so bad
a bread-market. But we can recommend
their quails, too soon fatigued to escape by
flight, and therefore taken by dogs and
unarmed Indians; and their pine apples,
and coffee from the near Montaña and hacienda
of Vitoc, are both very good, the latter
excellent.</p>

<p>The centre land of Peru abounds in
streams and mountain torrents, subject at
certain periods to sudden and tumultuous
swells from the bursting of heavy thunder-clouds
and continued pouring rain, or pelting
hail and thick nocturnal snow-falls,
which quickly melt before the shining sun,
and fill the rivers to inundation. The consequence
of this is, that though the weather
may soon after become so fair and showerless
as to invite the traveller to proceed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
his journey, yet every now and then he may
have deep rivers or foaming ravines to cross,
where bridges of some sort become indispensable.</p>

<p>When the indigenous race in former times
had to pass any river on their route, their
engineers supplied, as best they could, the
wants of science by that natural sagacity
which belongs to their living posterity.
When their particular course allowed, they
placed their simple bridge near the origin
of the stream, or outlet of the lake whence
it happened to flow; as we see at the lakes
of Lauricocha and Pomacocha. As the
waters of the lake can never rise many feet
above the usual level, the purpose of a more
scientific bridge is served by the Indian
method of laying down large stones at short
intervals from bank to bank; and, as these
stones rise high above the surface of the
water, they serve as pillars or supporters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
over which are laid transversely large flags,
that form an even and safe path for the
passage of men and cattle. At the places
mentioned, the single stones, too wide apart
for stepping-stones, are still to be seen firm
in their places; though the transverse flags,
probably removed by human hands, are no
longer found; at least, at Pomacocha not
a vestige of them remains.</p>

<p>A more ingenious bridge of ancient invention,
and still used in Peru, is the swing
or soga bridge. It is made by ropes twined
from the pliable bejuco, twigs of willow, or
any other flexible and vegetable filaments;
and these are well secured at the ends on
the opposite banks of the water: on these,
bundles of maguey leaves, broom, or other
long-branched and yielding shrubs, are laid
crosswise, and bound very closely and firmly
by tough ligaments or slips of the maguey
leaf (“cabuia”), which answer as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
as the best cordage. In this way the bridge
is made of sufficient breadth for foot-passengers;
and a hand-rope runs along each
side of it, by which the traveller can
steady himself while walking across. A
specimen of this sort is the soga bridge of
modern Huanuco. At Oroya also, over the
river Jauja, is a very strong one of this kind
for cargo-mules to cross upon. The ropes,
or rather <i>cables</i>, extending from bank to
bank, are made of bullock’s hide; and the
cross-bars, bound down with thongs, are of
squared pieces of wood, and broad enough
to allow the animals to pass with confidence.
As this bridge is kept up at unusual expense,
and situated on the post-road to the interior,
we paid toll at it for passing our saddle-beasts.
The rope or swing-bridge is very
convenient where the river is too broad to
be spanned by any trees to be found in
the neighbourhood; but where the stream
is not much too wide to be crossed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
long trees and beams, of which the temperate
altitudes afford appropriate materials in
the wood known by the name of perijil
or roble, the natives manage to form a
strong and pretty durable bridge, by constructing
a large and massy stone breast-work
on each side the water. In these
bulwarks they fix strong timbers, which are
made to project over the stream as far as
may be required, while the larger portion
of the same timbers is covered by a heavy
weight of stones and earth: a tree of ordinary
length is found sufficient to overlay
the centre of the water; as, thus placed, it
rests its ends on the projecting timbers
already well secured in the midst of the
masonry at the opposite banks. These,
the most common of all Peruvian bridges,
are constructed and kept in repair by order
of the prefect of each department, who issues
the same to sub-prefects or governors of
provinces; and these again send out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
entire community of adjacent villages to
work under the direction of their respective
alcaldes and regidores.</p>

<p>There yet remains a very curious and
portable bridge to be mentioned, now falling
into disuse, but of which a specimen
may be yet seen at Viroy, on the river Huacar,
in the department of Junin: this
antique relic is named “Guaro.” It is constructed
by extending a single strong lazo
from one side of the stream to the other,
which is well secured to the trunk of a tree,
or any such fixture, on the opposite banks:
from this a leathern bag, not unlike in appearance
to a canvass draw-bucket used
aboard ship, is suspended, so as to run easily
on the lazo; the passenger sits in the bag,
and slides himself quietly across. Bridges of
this description are said to have been exceedingly
useful to the Montonera, or irregular
patriot troops, during the late war that ended
in the separation of Peru from Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Another contrivance for passing lakes
and rivers in the Andes is the “balsa,” a
very small canoe made of rushes. Its surface
is level; and when the paddler and
only one passenger steady themselves upon
it, the canoe is pressed down into the water
to within about an inch or two of its
surface,—so, at least, was the only one we
had occasion to enter; as, upon a journey
during the floods of the wet season, we
swam our cattle, and crossed ourselves in
a balsa of rushes over the river of San
Juan, on the plains of Bombon, near Pasco.</p>

<p>The water-courses of the ancient Peruvians
are traced along the chasms of rocks
and sides of arid eminences in the vicinity
of the coast, and in the dry intermediate
glens. These aqueducts sometimes appear
marvellously constructed among the most
rugged crags, and in some points are raised
to an astonishing elevation. They are
reared from very slender foundations here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and there among the now receding, now
approaching, shelves of the rocks and
cliffs. These piles of irregular mason-work
are fabricated with small and thin
stones, or light flags, leaning upon every
favourable projection along the steep against
the front of which the fabric rises; and
all the works thus constructed are so
solidly and closely united, that after the
lapse of ages, and in the land of earthquakes
too, they are still in numberless
instances nearly perfect.</p>

<p>One of the most striking of these aqueducts
is about eight leagues from Lima, on
the low road to Alcacota by Caballeros, on a
high rocky acclivity, along the base of which
runs the road, close by the winding of the
river Chillon or Carabaillo, which descends
from the Cordillera, by Obrajillo. It is also
very usual in the temperate valleys, where
the hills are flanked with soil, and clothed
in vegetation, to meet here and there the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
ruins of small villages with files of successively
rising platforms on the hollow side
of a hill. These tiers of artificial flats, or
gardens, are generally only a few yards in
breadth; but in length greater or less, in
proportion to the dimensions of the semi-circular
sweep of the recess capable of cultivation.</p>

<p>In rearing up and constructing these gardens
the one above the other, like the pews in
the gallery of a church or boxes in a theatre,
the ancient Indian must have begun his work
by erecting a stone wall on the lower part of
the slope, or more even ground, that formed
the base of the series; and, as it was in
process of rising to the desired height, the
earth must have been scraped down from
the side of the acclivity, to fill up the space
thus partitioned off into a level bank or
platform: then, behind this first level was
raised another stony partition, and more
earth again scraped down; and so on successively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
till the uppermost and last tier of
these little and tasteful gardens was completed.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>By such means these industrious natives
always preserved deep soil, which they
might dig up and turn over at pleasure,
bringing a new surface of earth to yield a
new crop without necessity of manure;
and by the same contrivance they preserved
from the washings of the frequent and
heavy rains, the treasure of vegetable loam
which they thus so laboriously and patiently
amassed.</p>

<p>As we descend from the inner regions of
the country, and get down among the arid
and naked granite mountains near the
coast, we see the ruins of Pagan dwellings
showing themselves in the crevices of the
rocks, where no plant is seen on the waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
land, save a few scattered cacti, and no
moving creature except the lizard that
basks, and the kite that waits its motions,
on the crumbling ruins and circumjacent
blocks which have been rolled from their
original seats on the face of the steep. And
as we approach still nearer the capital, where
Glen Rimac unfolds its wide and fertile
acres of deep alluvial soil, we see that this
goodly land, when denied water, puts on a
look of desert sterility; but that it only requires
irrigation—it needs no manure—to
yield productive sugar-cane, and to throw
forth choice lucern and Indian corn, that
waves above the head of the overseer as he
passes on horseback through the fields, superintending
labourers.</p>

<p>As we enter these plains, susceptible of indefinite
improvement and vast returns, we
are everywhere surrounded with the vestiges
of antiquity, particularly with the
ruins of guacas, that at a distance look like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
little hills or knolls scattered over the open
plains; but we think that they were once
used as so many tombs of the Sun-worshippers
of the land. In some of these mouldering
monuments there are yet to be found internal
chambers or sepulchral vaults, entered
by very narrow openings; and, from these
labyrinths, mummies, cloths of different colours,
various domestic utensils, and sacred
figures and idols, have been not unfrequently
extracted. We have in our possession a neat
silver idol in the figure of an Inca, with a
llama of the same material and workmanship,
procured from a guaca, and presented
to us by our friend the Rev. Dr. Don Lucas
Pellicer, an eminent and classical Limeño,
of whose merits as a scholar and patriotic
statesman his country feels justly proud.
Many other curious relics of an ancient
people are dug out from the same edifices, of
which the assiduous Don Mariano Rivero
has made the most extensive and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
collection which is now extant in
Peru; and with correct drawings and descriptions
of these he has, for some time back,
proposed to favour the public, and to enrich
the history of his native country.</p>

<p>The tombs from which relics of this kind
are usually taken are not, however, confined
to the neighbourhood of Lima, Truxillo,
or the coast in general, where their structure
of moulded earth and sun-burnt clay
is best preserved on account of the absence
of rain. Such remains are still seen in some
parts of the Sierra; and in speaking of the
guacas, (which he conceives to have been
temples) in his “Historia natural y moral
de las Indias,” vol. ii. p. 128, Acosta tells
us that “there were in Cuzco<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
than four hundred temples of idols, looked
upon as sacred earth, and all places were
full of mysteries. As they” (the Incas)
“went on with their conquests, so they
introduced their own guacas and rites
into all that state. The Great Being whom
they adored was the Viracocha Pachayachic,
who is the Creator of the world; and after
him the Sun; and thus they said that the
Sun, like all the other guacas, received virtue
and being from the Creator, and that
they were intercessors with him.”</p>

<p>We left Lima about noon, and rode
along a broad and stony road-way by the
skirts of the hills, now, in the month of
January, dry and sterile masses of soil
and rock. To our left extended the fine
but neglected valley of Chillon, once highly
cultivated, and susceptible of rich improvement.
We passed several Indian edifices,
constructed of mud cast in huge moulds,
which yet in some degree preserve their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
forms, notwithstanding the ravages committed
upon them by time and earthquakes.
These always appear above the level of irrigated
land, as if intended wisely to avoid
the reach of marsh effluvia, so eminently
pernicious to the health of the aborigines.</p>

<p>We arrived in good time at Caballeros,
distant six leagues from Lima, and slept
very soundly, in defiance of the ceaseless
barking of dogs, tinkling of mules’ bells, and
noisy chattering of negroes. On the morning
following we started at an early hour,
with a hope that before the sun came out in
his strength we might get over the parched
ground of the Rio-Seco. From the heights
of this hill-bound recess,—so dreary to the
eye, gloomy to the imagination, and everywhere
strewed with blanched bones and
skeletons of wearied, foundered, and famished
animals, left here to perish,—there
opens suddenly and at once on the traveller’s
delighted vision an unexpected view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of the irrigated enclosures of the village of
Yanga, close to the winding river, whose
banks are clothed in vivid verdure, and garnished
with trees always shady and evergreen.</p>

<p>From this cheering eminence, in times
of the greatest misrule, the traveller can
indulge in the delightful feeling of security,
as he casts a backward glance over
the dark furnace of the Rio Seco, so appropriate
for the infernal deeds of banditti
for which it is celebrated, and then descends
in good spirits to Alcacota and
Yanga, congratulating himself on having
got safely through a desolate and perilous
route, where wayfarers are often plundered
and abused, and, when they offer inefficient
resistance, sacrificed and murdered.</p>

<p>Two leagues higher than Yanga are the
church and ruins of Santa Rosa de Quive,
overlooking the only habitable house of this
stage, (a sort of <i>tambo</i> or tavern,) by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
banks of a mountain torrent which descends
to join the main river of the valley,
from the high hills on the right, through
an intersecting ravine. In the arid season
on the upland, it is nearly dried up; but,
in the wet, its turbid waters roll with impetuous
course, hurling immense round
stones along their channel, and sending
forth sounds that may be heard by the
traveller at the tambo,—telling him he cannot
ford the stream till the river lowers,
but must cross a bad bridge of pieces of
timber with some earth and sticks, laid
over a narrow part of the ravine, considerably
higher up than the usual ford.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of this stream is
Santa Rosa; here are several houses overlooking
a small wooded plain between it
and the main river, where men are always
employed in cutting and charring wood,
which is sent to Lima, fourteen leagues distant.
The disease which the natives call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
<i>Uta</i>, a species of cancer well known among
chimney-sweeps in England, prevails in this
place. We have also seen here the most
severe ague, originating at the season when
it rains <i>in the hills</i> of the Cordillera (for
here it never rains), and when the torrent
alluded to inundates, and overspreads with
large stones, sand, and slime, the flat ground
near its disemboguement.</p>

<p>Four leagues higher up than Santa Rosa
is a place called Yaso, once a flourishing
hacienda, with a garden where lucumas,
pacays, guayavas, and sour oranges are still
seen; but where, in place of a flourishing
estate, there are now but a few huts of cane
and hurdles, partially bedaubed with mud,
and furnished with open corridors, under
which the muleteers and travellers stretch
themselves to sleep: but as lucern is scarce,
and as there is no natural pasture, few choose
to pass the night here; though many call
for a glass of <i>chicha</i>, or country beer made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
from maize, to quench their thirst while
resting here at noon, when the sun is reflected
powerfully from the towering and
naked hills around.</p>

<p>The river water being always turbid in
time of inland rains, the traveller is tempted
to drink of a pure and crystalline stream
that here issues from the rock; but the
good-natured inmate of some wretched hut
warns him of his danger, and assures him,
if he drink that water, he will be seized
with the severe disease called verrugas, or
a painful warty eruption, peculiar to certain
quebradas; and Yaso, it may be kept in
mind, is one of the localities subject to this
sore visitation. A couple of leagues still
higher up the “quebrada,” or glen, is the resting-place—Huaramayo;
a little green spot,
with a few neat huts surrounded with plots
of lucern, and many rugged fragments from
the neighbouring steeps.</p>

<p>We observed that one of these humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
dwellings, made of mud, cane, and wicker,
was thatched with a sort of living lichen;
a simple style of architecture, which of
itself tells us that here the climate is still
dry and warm, and the place sheltered from
rude winds or storms.</p>

<p>We have seen the cottager, who occupied
the hut immediately at the foot of the arduous
ascent which here commences, look with
indescribable complacency as we, from his
little corridor, gazed up in admiration at
beholding the rain pour in torrents a few
hundred yards above us, while his own snug
retreat was hardly reached by a gentle sprinkling,
which a Limenian would call “<i>agua bendita</i>,”
or holy water, which imparted softness
and salubrity to the air, and gave longevity
to the aged inmate of the cottage.</p>

<p>This now bent and year-worn, but still
active and lively octogenarian, was in his
youth a shoemaker in Lima; and being
attacked with hæmoptysis, or spitting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
blood, and pronounced incurable by the
doctors, he sought for the benefit to be
derived from change of climate, and found,
after repeated trials, that as often as
he returned to Lima his disease of the
lungs was renewed, but again removed as
often as he arrived at this elfin abode,
twenty leagues from the capital. For these
good reasons he resolved to settle here, a
favoured site where even ague is unknown;
and had, when we saw him, already attained
a ripe yet energetic old age.</p>

<p>Were this spot a spacious plain like
Glen-Rimac, enjoying the climate which
it now does, it would be as calm and
bright and beauteous as a druidical paradise,
and we might even conceive how
man might live in such a climate and
on such a soil to an antediluvian measure
of years.</p>

<p>From Yanga to Huaramayo, the glen
through which lies the road to Cerro Pasco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
by Canta is extremely narrow and confined,
except at Santa Rosa, where it is somewhat
more open. The way often recedes from,
though it is generally in sight of, the bed of
the river; and is bound in on each side by
lofty and sterile granite mountains, which,
on the left side of the river as we ascend,
are frequently intersected with narrow, perpendicular
veins that arise from the level
of the water to the very summit of the
mountain, and, from the road, present a
ferruginous appearance, suggesting the idea
of grand conductors of the electric fluid.
It is only by continued irrigation that the
few patches and strips of soil, which at
this distance here and there relieve the
tedium of a rugged way, are compelled to
throw forth their vegetable luxuriance.</p>

<p>At Huaramayo the temperature is intermediate
between that of Sierra and the coast;
and, as in the warm inland valleys in the centre
of the Andes, so here, in a region of corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
benignancy on the western acclivity
of the same great mountain pile, we
have the tree called molle, or mulli, in abundance
along the river’s edge. This tree is
much prized as fuel; and the sugar-refiners
of the interior use the ashes from it, in preference
to those from any other wood, on
account of their higher alkaline properties,
and consequent efficiency in purifying the
cane juice while being boiled down to a
proper consistence to be cast in moulds.
The Inca tribe, as we learn from Garcilaso
de la Vega,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> made a highly valued and medicinal
beer, which some of the Indians of
the interior still occasionally prepare, from
the clusters of small-grained fruit that hang
gracefully and abundantly from this pretty
tree. We have said that the climate here
corresponds to that of the warm central
valleys of the Andes; but though analogous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
in several respects, yet there is this marked
difference, that at Huaramayo, and other
headlands like Huaramayo, as, for example,
Surco, on the San Mateo route to the
Sierra from Lima, there is neither winter
nor summer, but one perpetual spring. It
does not rain here for several months in the
year, as in the more inland vales; but it agrees
with them in being out of the sphere of frosts,
and exempted from the raw fogs and sultry
heat of the coast. At Surco, Huaramayo,
and other similar localities in narrow glens
extending from the coast to the Cordilleras,
the sun appears to rise late and to set early,
for it is only for a few hours in the middle of
the day that it shines strongly between the
perpendicular and lofty hills of the valley;
and the mid-day heat arising from the powerful
reflection of the sun’s rays on the bare
rocks is succeeded by a cool and agreeable
evening. Here then the atmospherical currents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of mountains and coast meet and neutralize
each other,—the extremes of both
disappear: and the result is a delicious climate
for the convalescent, whose tender organs
require a gentle uniform temperature,
alike removed from the extremes of heat and
cold, dryness and moisture; and he who has
the precaution or prudence to keep in the
shade while the sun crosses the vale in the
middle of the day, may, in truth, enjoy undisturbed
all the curative qualities of a delightful
and renovating temperature. With this important
fact the delicate inhabitants of Lima
are perfectly acquainted, and they are accustomed
to resort to the cabezadas, or headlands
of valleys, where these verge on the
joint air of mountains and coast; as, for example,
Matucana, the favourite resting-place
of phthisical and hæmoptic individuals, who
find themselves obliged to retire from the capital,
in order to recover health by visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
those celebrated sites of convalescence—Tarma
and Jauja.</p>

<p>Close to Huaramayo, and by the old line of
road, begin the steep ascents called the Paxaron,
because of the number of paroquets always
seen about this place. The path along
their acclivity is narrow, fatiguing, and precipitous,
to very near the village of Obrajillo, a
distance of several leagues. On the airy hill-tops,
that overlook this way and the ravine
below it, are several villages which are only
to be approached by a zigzag and arduous
track; and hereabouts, if anywhere on the
Canta route, are to be seen examples of the
terrific in scenery, for those whose eyes are
unaccustomed to the native ruggedness of
bold and alpine regions. A young gentleman
of our acquaintance, who was familiar with
nothing but downs and lawns, was affected at
the steeps of the Paxaron with a giddiness
that, for some time after, disordered his imagination;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and we have seen travellers clash
at the worst passes with no small risk in the
encounter, where the moving party on the
outer verge of the declivity was obliged, for
want of room, to brush rudely against the
other party standing still on the higher and
safer side of the road: and here too, when a
weak or weary beast trips, the rider is in
danger of toppling over the brink; and the
want of parapets makes the road all but impracticable
in a dark night.</p>

<p>Canta and Obrajillo are situated in the
same opening among the mountains: the
latter is entirely the residence of muleteers,
whose strong and active women share in the
labours of the field; while Canta, on an eminence,
is a provincial town, and the seat of a
governorship.</p>

<p>The village of Obrajillo is built in a sort
of irregular hollow near the bed of a small
river, surrounded by arable hills receding and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
expanding as they rise towards the loftier
summits, and therefore affording better ventilation
than is to be found in any part of the
valley between this and Yanga.</p>

<p>From Yanga to Huaramayo, the hills, as
we formerly stated, are doomed to perpetual
sterility, and are all unacquainted with the
genial influence of dew or rain; but across
the summits of the Paxaron we meet with
footsteps of that plentiful herbage, with
which, at Canta and Obrajillo, the straths
and steeps are richly covered.</p>

<p>As Canta is considered a sort of hospital
for the ailing people from Lima, it may be
proper to remark, that in a medical point
of view, it is invested with a great deal of
interest, and that it is built on a hill whose
base skirts the village of Obrajillo; while,
from the plaza of the lower village to the
higher town, the ascent is no more than
about thirty minutes’ walk. Canta, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
is considered to enjoy a far purer air
than Obrajillo; and, as it is only twenty-five
leagues from the capital, the hectic,
phthisical, and slowly convalescent Limenians,
are wont to prefer this to remoter districts.
By the people of Obrajillo and Canta,
alfalfa, or lucern, is everywhere cultivated
near the river and in their little enclosures,
and the surrounding hills are covered with
pasture: the lower declivities and gentle
slopes produce good crops of wheat, beans,
potatoes, maize, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Here the culen is one of the most common
shrubs, and the natives make a tea of its
leaves which is deemed an excellent stomachic.
During the wet season flowers and
flowering shrubs are spread abroad with
liberal profusion; but the trees are too few
to supply the wants of the inhabitants,
whose houses are therefore constructed at
great trouble; being obliged to convey timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
from distant places and deep ravines. The
stone or adobe walls and thatched roofs of
the small villages or pueblos of the Sierra
characterize, with only one exception, the
buildings of Obrajillo. The dwelling-houses
are employed for stowing potatoes, maize,
and whatever eatables the residents may be
blessed with; and, when the family retire to
rest, most of them lie down on sheep-skins
wherever they can find room in their disorderly
apartments. We need hardly observe
that every traveller on these roads
must carry with him his own blanket or
ponchos to repose on at night.</p>

<p>At Obrajillo there are in all about sixty
families; and we saw a maudlin school-master
among them with only six pupils,
whom he taught, <i>sub Jove</i>, in an open corral.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
He was looked upon as a <i>savant</i> by the
villagers, some of whom found him useful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
drawing up their accounts; and we observed
that he spoke about the zoology of Aristotle
when a friend of ours displayed his more
practical zeal and science in collecting and
preserving specimens of ornithology, in search
of which he frequently waded the river, gun
in hand; and a pretty sight it was to see
the delicately plumaged diving ducks exhibit
wonderful agility, in passing the most foaming
rapids. This village of arrieros, or muleteers,
is about half-way between Lima and
that great source of mineral wealth the Cerro
Pasco. From the capital to the Cerro a
rider on a good traveller will arrive in four
days without injury to himself or beast, and
this is considered good work; but we have
known the journey from the Cerro to Lima
performed in about fifty hours: this again is
a work of over-exertion for the man, who is
very likely to incapacitate one or perhaps two
animals in the undertaking. It may be said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
in general, that on a rough and hilly road a
league an hour is a fair rate of travelling for
a fresh beast on any ordinary journey in the
interior of Peru.</p>

<p>The traveller cannot have any dealing
with the muleteers without discovering that
he is entirely in their power; and that they
will furnish him no cattle for his journey,
unless he pay them money on account, or
“adelantado,” beforehand. Of course he
will have to advance some part of the mule-hire
before he can budge on another man’s
beast; but he should not be ignorant of the
Peruvian rule on such occasions, which is,
to suspect every man to be a cheat till
very certain of the contrary,—a rule which
is entirely indispensable. Acting upon the opposite
English precept,—to believe every man
honest till we find him a rogue,—we were
once cheated by the military commandant
of Junin, who, being paid “adelantado” for
two beasts for the next morning’s journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
furnished one of them with only three legs,
the fourth being so contracted that it could
not reach the ground. He maintained—and,
as he was the first authority in the place, he
did so successfully—that as he only agreed
to provide two beasts, without respect to
quality, he would neither replace the lame
nag, nor return our dollars.</p>

<p>The arrieros with cargoes usually take
nine or ten days, and sometimes more, from
Lima to Pasco, as they make short stages,
consulting the ease of their cattle and convenience
of lucern or pasture; and at Obrajillo
they commonly rest a day at least, to
refresh or perhaps relay some of their cattle,
before they proceed to brave the toils of the
Cordillera. From Obrajillo to Culluai, a
small village near the foot of the Cordillera,
there are three leagues; and the road leads
through a rock-bound passage by the course
of a river with a rugged bottom and ruffled
stream. There are one or two bad passes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
be surmounted in this part of the journey,
from the summit of one of which a panting
pony laden with part of our baggage once fell
over, and broke his neck in the fall. This
narrow quebrada or break, is not destitute
of interest to the botanist; as in the rainy
season, amongst the interspaces of the stones
and crags, flowering shrubs of considerable
beauty and variety present themselves: indeed,
the highest Cordillera entrances are not
without their hardy flowers amid the shelves
of the rocks. We may remark that, between
the cliffs in the neighbourhood of Culluai,
may be seen samples of those tiers of gardens,
built up one above the other on the face of
the acclivity, to which we alluded in our
preceding chapter, “on the general features
of the Sierra,” as surviving proofs of the
industry of the ancient Peruvians.</p>

<p>At this same altitude many susceptible
persons begin to feel inconvenience from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
rarefaction of the atmosphere, and from want
of provision for the stomach, if they happen
not to have their own alforjas, or saddle-bags,
properly provided with necessaries
for the journey. It is only in the <i>puna</i>
and table-lands that meat is sure to be had,
with, perhaps, potatoes and cancha or toasted
maize; but, should the traveller ask for
any thing else, he is told “Manam cancha”—there
is none.</p>

<p>Between Culluai on one side, and Casacancha,
an estancia with a mean hut or two,
on the other side of the Cordillera, the distance
is five leagues; and about a league or
more from Culluai we begin to ascend by the
Viuda, or Widow, a towering mountain that
stands out as it were apart from the other
great masses that at this point group together
to form a portion of the great Western Cordillera:
and it may be sometimes convenient
to know, that on the right-hand side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Viuda, as we ascend the road that winds
round its flank, there is concealed in a recess
close to the line of snow the Indian hamlet of
Yantac.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Before the arriero attempts to ascend
the Cordillera, he anoints, as we have
seen him do, his cattle over the eyes and on
the forehead with an unguent made of tallow,
garlic, and wild marjoram, as a preventive
against what he calls the veta; attributing
the effects of atmospherical rarefaction to a
subterraneous <i>veta</i>, or vein of a noxious ore
or metal, which, he believes, diffuses in the
air of the cold summits and heights its mephitic
and poisonous particles.</p>

<p>The Cordillera crossed at noon, and in
dry weather, is a grand sight. When we
first crossed it the sun was out in full
blaze; and, though the mountains of snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
lay on every side of our way, we felt quite
warm, but we observed that in the shade
the cold was very chilling.</p>

<p>It was to us peculiarly exhilarating to
gaze on so many snowy monuments reflected
in all their sublimity from the green waters
of the lakes beneath, thickly thronged with
sportive ducks and cormorants. These reservoirs
of rain and melted snow, which
here and there challenge the traveller’s admiration,
are like so many appropriate mirrors,
successively disclosed to the eye among
the concavities and basins that separate the
majestic heads of the hoary Andes.</p>

<p>In a neighbouring and far grander part
of the Cordillera, to which on another occasion
we clambered by a narrow, rocky,
and steep path, we were caught in a sudden
fall of thick mist, which at once unrolled
its folds, and threw over the broad
light of a clear and frosty morning the dark
obscurity of night. This transition was accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
by no thunder or lightning, or
sensible commotion of any kind; and after
the darkness continued a few minutes, on
looking upwards towards the firmament a
scantling of rays began to shoot from among
the clouds, and a certain though ill-defined
body of light could be distinguished as the
centre whence those rays seemed to emanate,
when, in an instant after, the peak of a
mountain—a crystallized pyramid of snow—glistened
to view, and shone in the fullest
blaze of brilliancy. With such celerity did
the cloudy curtain drop and vanish on the
face of the deep dark lake of Pomacocha,
that the whole scene appeared but as a
vision of enchantment.</p>

<p>But to return: we safely crossed the last
rib of the Cordillera, and descended into
the plain of Casacancha, where we did not
stop, but pressed forward three leagues beyond
this common halting-place to take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
our night’s quarters at Palcomayo, another
common stage or resting-place for travellers
on this unprovided though much frequented
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>But we had not left Casacancha far behind,
when one of our fellow-travellers experienced
the most distressing headache: his
face became turgid, the temporal arteries
throbbed with violence, the respiration was
difficult, and it seemed to him as if the chest
was too narrow for its contents. The other
gentleman complained less; it was only a
vexatious headache that disturbed him, but
his eyes were blood-shot. The writer was still
differently affected from either of his fellow-travellers.
His headache was moderate; but
his extremities soon became quite cold as
the sun declined; the skin shrank, and then
came on a sense of sickness and oppression
about the stomach and heart, with a short,
hurried, and panting respiration. His kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
associates on this occasion forgot their own
ailments in attending to his more urgent
wants. They had him carefully wrapped
in warm sheep-skins, which formed the usual
bedding of the poor Indian family within,
and renovated his strength by a cordial basin
of hot tea. In this manner, and immersed
at the time in the pungent smoke that
filled the whole hut, the natural warmth of
the extremities and surface was soon restored,
so that he became comparatively easy, and
passed a better night than either of his two
obliging friends.</p>

<p>The servant intrusted with the cargo-mule
dropped behind; and not being acquainted
with the route, or able to keep
sight of us, he went off the road, wandered
into a neighbouring valley, Caraguacayan, and
did not appear till morning. The gentlemen
alluded to had, therefore, to shift for the night
as less provided travellers usually do. Their
<i>alforjas</i> (saddle-bags) served them as pillows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
their <i>pellons</i> and saddle-cloths for
beds, and their <i>ponchos</i> as their best covering.
They thus lay cooped up on the floor
of a dirty little hovel, too small to allow
them to stretch their limbs without risk of
burning their toes in the hot ashes around
the fire-place. The sharp wind pierced
through a hundred crevices of the rude wall,
and was ill excluded from the low and narrow
door-way by a tattered sheep-skin fitted
with thongs into a hurdle-frame.</p>

<p>Restless, chirping guinea-pigs—constant
inmates of every wretched hut,—persevered
during the early part of the night in a bold
attack on our bread magazines; pulling at
our wallets, placed under our heads, and
nibbling at their contents with a degree of
boldness and fearlessness which we believe
hunger only could inspire. These assailants
had scarcely left us to repose in the
silence of night, when the wakeful cock
from a chink in the wall (originally occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
by an image or household saint) began
his repeated crowing at unmeasured periods
till well on towards grey morning, when all
were in motion: the shepherd rounded his
flock, guarded all night against the hostility
of the fox and other enemies by the faithful
dogs inseparable from the sheep; the muleteer
shook himself in his poncho, and went
to collect his mules; and the housewife left
her sheep and llama-skin bed, and commenced
her daily task of boiling the caldo,
or soup, for breakfast, and smoking her
guests from their uneasy couch.</p>

<p>With so many incitements to bestir ourselves,
we were glad to turn out and breathe
the fresh air, while things were getting ready
for our departure on a fresh day’s journey,
with only a headache left for our common
annoyance.</p>

<p>The writer had frequent occasion afterwards
to cross this same part of the Cordillera,
and, profiting by his first lesson, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
took care always to start early in the morning
on his day’s journey, so as to arrive
early in the evening at his quarters for the
night. He got refreshment, and turned into
bed as soon as possible after his arrival; and
took care that he slept warm and dry. By
thus avoiding cold and wet, which check
perspiration and overload the deep-seated
blood-vessels, he ever after on this route
avoided the Cordillera sickness.</p>

<p>More than once we have witnessed the
most affecting scenes of moaning and suffering,
without the additional misery of the
veta, when some wet and cold traveller arrived
at Casacancha<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> at a late hour, and
threw down as his couch his already half-soaked
pellon on a damp mud floor, or earthen
bench, and covered himself up for the night
with his drenched ponchos. In the morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
a traveller so circumstanced may find
his ponchos half-frozen over him; and when
he arises, and looks out, he often sees the
plain covered with snow which has locked up
the herbage from the reach of the shivering
cattle that stand fettered on the plain.</p>

<p>On these roads, especially at a season
when there is reason to expect foul weather,
it is best that the traveller should
make use of a beast hired of the arriero,
who is far more likely to take care of his
own mule than of one belonging to another
owner, and men are not always to be had to
watch cattle let loose in these high pastures
at night. The cold is almost sure to scare
homeward any animal not seasoned to it;
so that, if the cattle be left to themselves,
a traveller in the morning may be disappointed
by their escape, and unable to proceed
on his journey. The arrieros usually
encamp for the night wherever it best
suits their cattle in the “<i>puna</i>,” near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
huts of Casacancha or Palcomayo, and are
so accustomed to it that they lie and slumber
sweetly we will not say, but soundly enough,
among bits of sheep-skin and <i>jerga</i>, or woollen
sweating-cloths used to protect the backs
and shoulders of the cattle, under whose
“<i>aparejos</i>,” or pads, placed standing on the
ground, they creep in and find shelter for the
night; but in such lodgings no one of acute
olfactory nerves could possibly be induced to
remain for a minute.</p>

<p>From Palcomayo to Cerro Pasco is a
roughly computed distance of fourteen or
fifteen leagues, over hilly and frigid pasture-grounds,
named “puna;” or over “pampas,”
like the plains of Bombon, through
part of which the road passes. This journey
can rarely be performed in one day without
inconvenience to man and beast, and therefore
it is usually divided; and the traveller
may put up at the village of Hualliay, or the
hacienda of Diezmo,—each of these places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
being about seven leagues from Cerro Pasco,
and separated from one another by a range
of low hills, and some very remarkable-looking
rocks, near the entrance into the table-land
of Bombon, which are usually covered
with cattle and fleecy flocks.</p>

<p>The higher, and, it is said, the shorter
route from Palcomayo, is that by Hualliay,
but it is fenny, and only practicable in the
dry season; the other route by Diezmo,
though somewhat longer, is the safest and
best, and is usually followed by the arriero.
By either direction, rivers are to be passed,
deep and dark in times of flood. By the
Hualliay way the ride is rendered interesting
on account of the frequently-heard whistle of
the vicuña, keeping watch over his fellows
and giving warning of the traveller’s approach,
when the whole herd leave their
pasturage and bound away to more inaccessible
heights. Geese, too, are very numerous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and there is a lake to be passed which
is the favourite resort of the elegant flamingos.
To see a flock of them upon wing is a
magnificent sight.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Account of another route between Pasco and Lima, by Junin,
Huaypacha, Pucara, Tucto.—Mines of Antacona, Casapalca,
Pomacancha, San Mateo, San Juan de Matucana, Surco,
Cocachacra, Santa Ana, and lastly, Chaclacayo.—Enumeration
of a series of rocks, as they appear in succession
from the pass of the Cordillera to the entrance into the
Vale of Rimac.</p>

</div>


<p>The most frequented route between Lima
and Pasco is that which we have described in
the foregoing chapter; but, before we offer any
particular account of Cerro Pasco, we may
hastily run over the road which is sometimes
taken from this place to the capital during
the heavy falls of the periodical rains in the
inland mountains, when several of the rivers
on the road by Canta are deep and dangerous
rapids. This route across a pass of the
Cordillera at Tucto, near Yauli, is occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
preferred, as being shorter than the post-road
by Tarma.</p>

<p>The traveller, who starts at an early hour
from Cerro Pasco, passes by the villages
of Old Pasco and Carhuamayo, and arrives
in good time at the village of Junin, or
Reyes. The ride is mostly by the lake
of Chinchaycocha, and on pampa or nearly
level ground. From Junin, he, on his second
day’s journey, which is only counted
as seven leagues, traverses the spacious plain
of the same name, so justly memorable
in the annals of South American independence,
till he reaches that swampy ground,
and crosses the very defile, where, in the
year 1824, the Patriots were charged by
the Spanish cavalry; and now, leaving this
field of glory behind, he crosses to Huaypacha
along a hilly pastoral district, with
scarcely any regular footpath,—a circumstance
which often renders a guide necessary.
The silver ore of Huaypacha is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
poor in the present day to allow its mines
to be worked with spirit. Here the principal
metalliferous works are on the mine
estate of Olevegoya and the well-informed
Don Miguel Otero; where also a considerable
portion of alcaser, or green barley, is
raised as fodder for the cattle employed at
the works. The entrance into Huaypacha
is highly picturesque, from the striking configuration
of the limestone rocks in which
the silver is deposited, and which overhang
and everywhere surround this neat mining
village.</p>

<p>From Huaypacha we cross the river Jauja,
over a soga-bridge of the same sort of materials
with another at Oroya formerly described.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The next day’s ride, of about the
same length with the preceding, is made
over hilly pasture-ground to Tucto by Pucara,—the
latter place, now in ruins, being
once a famous mining establishment belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
to Don Pedro Arriarte, the great miner
of Peru. At Tucto several Indian huts, and
some of them of ridiculously small dimensions,
are to be seen near the road; but
lower down, and situated near a lake at the
base of the Cordillera, is a mining estate in
good order, though its mines in these latter
times have proved ruinous to the miner.
The soil around this estate is of a yellowish
tint, and is said to abound in gold (a gold
mine being also close to the house); and the
stones by the road-side are, in numerous
instances, covered with crusts of iron pyrites,
which impart to them a beautiful appearance,
such as, in the imagination of many unacquainted
with mineralogy, may serve to give
a very flattering idea of the golden treasure
of this place.</p>

<p>On the heights of Tucto, to the extent of
about half a league along the Cordillera, the
surrounding rocks appear like vast masses of
rusty iron, which, however, when a specimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
is taken up and broken, presents the character
of porphyry; but, as we proceed onward
towards the summit of the Cordillera, no
rocks are to be seen on the acclivity along
which we travel, except we look high up,
where, in form of mouldering projections,
they rise amidst the débris which covers this
part of the Cordillera down to the verge
of the lakes beneath. The mule-road is a
sort of track across the flank of this mass of
loose and shuffling fragments, which consist
of porphyry, and extend a considerable way
towards Antacona, or the ruins of a mining
village so called, on the very highest ridge
of this mountain-pass. From the extent of
the vestiges of industry still remaining, and
the ruins of human dwellings seen among
the weather-beaten cliffs, we may infer that
these mines, like many others, abandoned
for want of proper hydraulic machinery,
at one time yielded useful metals and rich
returns. On the Antacona side of the pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
there is no appearance of permanent snow,
for here, as on the plains, though it fall, it
soon melts away; but just opposite, parallel
to the line of road, and only separated by a
marshy hollow in which several little lakes
are contained, there are mountains or summits
perpetually covered with snow of great depth,
and the marsh and lakes just mentioned are
supplied by rills which descend from the
snow. At the mouths of the mines of
Antacona, which are interspersed among
rocks of porphyry or porphyritic green-stone,
a great quantity of rubbish, extracted at a
remote period from under ground, is to be
seen. Among this rubbish there appears a
large quantity of iron pyrites with quartz,
and there is also a considerable quantity of
loose calcareous matter separated from the
ore by partial decomposition. We may
mention that the famous mine of Alpamina,
wrought in the present day in this vicinity,
is embedded in a matrix of limestone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Having descended some way from the
cross on the highest point of the pass of
Antacona, the surrounding rock (probably a
variety of porphyry) has a reddish appearance,
and is continued for a considerable
distance to the village of Casapalca; and
the soil also, at this part of the way, is of
the same colour with the rock. We may
likewise remark, that about the road-side,
and in the river or mountain-stream, which
is derived from the contribution of the numberless
rivulets issuing from the heights, we
see for the distance of about two leagues
numerous large and small pudding-stones of
the same reddish appearance.</p>

<p>Casapalca, distant by common reckoning
two long leagues from Tucto, is now considered
as a village or pueblo, though it
appears to have been originally merely a
mining establishment. Here the attention is
arrested by a pretty cascade, which, making
a great perpendicular descent, is received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
into the interior of a jutting rock; and, after
a subterranean passage of some extent, the
concealed waters reappear, and in a gentle
stream descend to join the river. From the
foot of the Cordillera to Casapalca the llama
thrives on the pasture, which it appears to
find sweetest within a short distance of the
snow-line.</p>

<p>From Casapalca to the next village below
it, called Pomacancha or Chicle, there are
two leagues of good road; and here green
barley may be sometimes had to feed the
hungry cattle, that are often nearly famished
by the time they have arrived this far, after
having crossed the Cordillera.</p>

<p>From Chicle to San Mateo, a distance
of three leagues, there are two roads,—one
by a famous steep or cuesta, and the other
through a picturesque but rugged ravine
along the windings of the river,—both of
which we took notice of in describing the general
features of the Sierra. San Mateo is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a muleteer village like that of Obrajillo already
described, and very much resembles it
in climate and productions, though the temperature
of the air may be a little colder
here than at Obrajillo.</p>

<p>In crossing by the high mountain-path
from Chicle to San Mateo, we observed that
where the ascent commences on the higher
side, or that nearest the Cordillera, the rock
at the base of the mountain consists of
porphyry; but, as we ascend the great
cuesta, the precipice assumes the character
of porphyritic green-stone. At the base of
the descent on the lower, or San Mateo side
of the mountain, there is by the road-side
a projection of rock which has the appearance
of mica-slate, but of which none of
our travellers took up a specimen; as by this
time the day was far gone, and both men
and cattle were fatigued, and anxious to
reach the lodgings for the night in time to
provide convenient accommodation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>From San Mateo to the next stage, or
the village of San Juan de Matucana,
the distance is four very long leagues,
mostly through a narrow and rock-bound
ravine.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a league below San
Mateo, green-stone rock discovers itself by
the way-side; and, soon after we pass this
crag, we cross the first of three bridges that
are thrown over the river within the distance
of little more than half a league
between the first and last, on account of
the narrowness of the ravine, that sometimes
on the one side, sometimes on the
other, hardly leaves space for a mule-road.
Before crossing, in our descent, the first
bridge, the rock is of limestone; but, on having
at this place passed the water to the
opposite side, the rock which presents itself
is trap, and it continues nearly all the
way from the first to the third or lowest
bridge, where we meet with quartz, rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
in very perpendicular and lofty masses.
The rafters of the bridge rest on a projecting
part of this towering cliff on the one
side, and on the other on a corresponding
projection of a formidable hill of porphyry
opposed to it.</p>

<p>The next variety of rock is one of trap
formation; it appears about half-way between
San Mateo and Matucana, and throws
off a great quantity of fragments of a slaty
appearance. On the lower side it is flanked
by a hill of porphyritic green-stone, which
continues to within half a league of Matucana.
This mass also throws off an immense
quantity of débris. The porphyritic
green-stone is followed by trachyte porphyry,
the rock of which commences a short
way above the village of Matucana, or San
Juan de Matucana; but, before the junction
of these rocks takes place, the road-way
is intersected by a wedge or angle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
composed of syenetic green-stone, or porphyry
with actynolite.</p>

<p>Having left Matucana (which is a considerable
village enjoying a mild atmosphere,
with some open ground around it,) for
Surco, two or three leagues lower down,
porphyry continues all the distance between
these two villages. It throws off
large fragments or masses, that nearly block
up the road and bed of the river.</p>

<p>Surco is a small village, which possesses
the temperature of Yaso on the Canta road;
and, like it, is notorious for its waters producing
the disease called verrugas, or warty
excrescences. From Surco to a league and
a half, or thereabouts, below it, we have
trachyte porphyry; and, as we ride along, it
becomes gradually coarser-grained, till each
grain at length appears as large as a hazel-nut.
It is succeeded by felspar porphyry,
which extends along the side of the ravine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
in which we travel to the extent of about
two leagues and a half, or a league below
the village called Cocachacra, situated
three leagues lower down the river or ravine
than Surco. Cocachacra, within twelve
leagues of the capital, is surrounded by fruit-trees;
and here the traveller may recline at
his ease in the grateful shade, while refreshment
may be procured for man and beast.</p>

<p>From one league below Cocachacra we
have syenite extending the distance of half
a league by our way. It is followed by
syenetic granite, and continues for some
distance with a varying aspect, till it runs
gradually into the coarse granite, which also
appears in large loose blocks heaped on
the face of the naked mountains between
Saint Ana and Chaclacayo as we enter the
headland of the Vale of Rimac.</p>

<p>The above-named villages of Chaclacayo
(six leagues from the city), Cocachacra,
Surco, Matucana, and San Mateo, afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
successive stages, and gradations of changes
of air and climate to invalids from Lima, who
are too enfeebled, or otherwise find it not
convenient, to proceed beyond San Mateo, or
to cross the Cordillera by Yauli for Tarma,
nineteen leagues to the north-east of San
Mateo.</p>

west. It stands six or seven miles inland from its sea-port of
Callao, and the more elevated part of the city is about five
hundred feet above the level of the sea. It has frequently
suffered from earthquakes, which are very common; and
one of the most remarkable occurred in the year 1828.
Houses of one story have their walls usually composed of
sun-burnt bricks called <i>adobes</i>; but, that they may be better
able to resist the shocks to which they are so often exposed,
they are principally constructed, when of more than one

San Lazaro, and has over it an excellent bridge close to the
palace. This bridge, accommodated with recesses and seats,
is greatly resorted to in fine evenings. The young ladies of
the metropolis, in their imposing evening party or tertulia attire
and decoration, are fond, in times of public tranquillity, to
saunter to the bridge on moonlight nights, and there to breathe
the pure air of mountain and sea blended and eddying as it
gives freshness to the pale cheek, and, in its cool and circling
current, wafts fragrance from the choice flowers at this social
hour gracefully wreathed around the Rimac beauties’ heads.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> This dress, peculiarly characteristic of Lima, is little
known in other parts of the country, if we except Truxillo.
Captain Basil Hall in his Journal, vol. i. p. 106, describes it
very correctly. “This dress,” says he, “consists of two parts,
one called the saya, the other the manto. The first is a
petticoat, made to fit so tightly, that, being at the same time
quite elastic, the form of the limbs is rendered distinctly
visible. The manto, or cloak, is also a petticoat; but, instead
of hanging about the heels, as all honest petticoats ought to
do, it is drawn over the head, breast, and face; and is kept
so close by the hands, which it also conceals, that no part of
the body, except one eye, and sometimes only a small portion
of one eye, is perceptible.”</p>

<p>We may observe that, though strange pranks are sometimes
indulged in under this disguise, yet it is considered, by those
accustomed to it, a convenient dress in itself, in a country
where it is usual to hear morning mass before there has
been time to braid and adjust the hair, which is sometimes so
long as almost to reach the pretty foot and ancle. It is therefore
considered a convenience by women of every class, and
even of every age, to slip over their ordinary house-dress a
saya and manto when they desire to go to the street “tapada,”
or with the head and face covered with the thin silken petticoat
or manto as described, without being put to the trouble of
appearing dressed in a more elegant and formal manner, or
after European fashion, as they do at evening parties, or when
they frequent places of public amusement,—as the theatre or
bull-ring, and promenade in calashes or carriages in their different
alamedas, or public walks. In allusion to the custom
of going veiled in the street, the true Limeña lady is agreeably
characterized by their common saying,</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> When the Spaniards took possession of Peru, the monarchy
of the Incas, according to the tradition of the Indians,
ascended to an epoch of about four centuries.</p>

<p>“That country had been, time immemorial, inhabited by
scattered, rude, and savage tribes, whose civilization originated
from the austral regions, among the people who inhabited the
vicinity of the great lake of Titicaca, in the district of Callao.
These Indians were probably more warlike, active, and intelligent
than their neighbours; and as there is scarcely any people
who do not, either from pride or superstition, trace themselves
to a heavenly origin, so did the Peruvians relate, that
there once suddenly appeared among them a man and woman,
whose aspect, dress, and language inspired them with wonder
and veneration. He called himself Manco Capac, she Mama
Oello; and they proclaimed themselves children of the sun,
whose worship and adoration they inculcated.”</p>

<p>“The kingdom remained in the line of their descendants,
who were ever regarded as the pure race of the sun; the princes
marrying their sisters, and the offspring of these unions being
alone eligible to the throne. From Manco to Huayna Capac
they counted a succession of twelve princes, who, partly by persuasion
and partly by arms, extended their religion, dominion,
and laws, through the immense region which runs from Chili
to the Equator, gaining or subduing all the people they encountered,
either in the mountains of the Cordilleras, or on the
plains of the coast. The Inca who most extended the empire
was Topa Yupanqui, who carried his conquests southward as far
as Chili, and on the north to Quito; although, according to most
authors, it was not he who conquered the latter province, but
his son Huayna Capac, the most powerful, wealthy, and able of
all the Peruvian princes.”</p>

<p>“In his reign were established, or greatly perfected, three
grand mediums of communication, necessary to provinces so
distant and various,—the use of a general dialect, the establishment
of posts for the prompt conveyance of intelligence, and
lastly, the two great roads which extend from Cuzco to Quito, a
distance of more than five hundred leagues. Of these two roads
one passes over the Sierras, the other crosses the plains, and
both were provided, at proper and convenient distances, with
lodgings or quarters, which were called tambos, where the monarch,
his court, and army, even though amounting to twenty
or thirty thousand men, might find rest and refreshment, and
even renew, if necessary, their arms and apparel.”—See pages
158-161 of the interesting work entitled, “Lives of Balboa
and Pizarro, from the Spanish of Don Manuel Josef Quintana,”
by Mrs. Hodson.</p>

bracing climate, in the midst of a valley, between the eastern
and western chains of Cordillera, has in its vicinity warm and
fertile ravines or glens. It is said to have been founded by
Manco Capac, the first Inca, in the middle of the eleventh
century; and Francis Pizarro took possession of it, in the
name of Charles I. King of Castile, on the 13th March 1534.
In the year 1590, this celebrated capital of the old Peruvian
empire suffered from a violent earthquake, which ruined a
great part of its ancient monuments. The architecture of the
great Temple of the Sun, and fortress, close to the city, still exhibit
a different style of masonry from that which we have
described above, and is most usual in the Sierra of Peru,
where there are numerous ruins of villages and tambos, constructed
with stone of very ordinary size. But, at Cuzco, the
ruins of the temple and fortress yet remaining are formed of
stones of vast magnitude, and of irregular shapes; yet, so
exactly are they adjusted, that no void, or cement, is visible at
their points of junction.</p>

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
